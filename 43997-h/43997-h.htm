<h2>THE HIMALAYA CLUB.</h2>

<p>It is some eighteen years since this institution was
founded, at Mussoorie, one of the chief sanataria in
the Himalaya mountains. Here all those who can
obtain leave, and who can afford the additional
expense, repair to escape the hot weather of the
plains. The season begins about the end of April,
and ends about the first week in October. The club
is open to the members of the civil and military services,
to the members of the bar, the clergy, and to
such other private gentlemen as are on the Government
House list, which signifies, "in society." The
club-house is neither an expensive nor an elegant
edifice, but it answers the purposes required of it.
It has two large rooms, one on the ground-floor,
and the other on the upper story. The lower room,
which is some sixty feet long by twenty-five wide, is
the dining-room, breakfast-room, and reception-room.
The upper room is the reading and the ball-room.
The club has also its billiard-room, which is
built on the ledge of a precipice; and its stables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which would astonish most persons in Europe. No
horses except those educated in India, would crawl
into these holes cut out of the earth and rock.</p>

<p>Facing the side-door is a platform about forty
yards long by fifteen feet wide; and from it, on a
clear day, the eye commands one of the grandest
scenes in the known world. In the distance are
plainly visible the eternal snows; at your feet are a
number of hills, covered with trees of luxuriant
foliage. Amongst them is the rhododendron, which
grows to an immense height and size, and is, when in
bloom, literally covered with flowers. On every hill,
on a level with the club, and within a mile of it, a
house is to be seen, to which access would seem impossible.
These houses are, for the most part, whitened
without as well as within; and nothing can exceed in
prettiness their aspect as they shine in the sun.</p>

<p>From the back of the club-house, from your bed-room
windows (there are twenty-three sets of apartments)
you have a view of Deyrah Dhoon. It appears
about a mile off. It is seven miles distant. The
plains that lie outstretched below the Simplon bear,
in point of extent and beauty, to the Indian scene,
nothing like the proportion which the comparatively
pigmy Mont Blanc bears to the Dewalgiri. From an
elevation of about seven thousand feet the eye embraces
a plain containing millions of acres, intersected
by broad streams to the left, and inclosed by a low
belt of hills, called the Pass. The Dhoon, in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
parts, is dotted with clumps of jungle, abounding with
tigers, pheasants, and every species of game. In the
broad tributaries to the Ganges and the Jumna, may
be caught (with a fly) the m√¢hseer, the leviathan
salmon. Beyond the Pass of which I have spoken,
you see the plains of Hindoostan. While you are
wrapped in a great coat, and are shivering with the
cold, you may see the heat, and the steam it occasions.
With us on the hills, the thermometer is at
forty-five; with those poor fellows over there, it is at
ninety-two degrees. We can scarcely keep ourselves
warm, for the wind comes from the snowy range; they
cannot breathe, except beneath a punkah. That
steam is, as the crow flies, not more than forty miles
from us.</p>

<p>We are all idlers at Mussoorie. We are all sick,
or supposed to be so; or we have leave on private
affairs. Some of us are up here for a month between
musters. We are in the good graces of our colonel
and our general&mdash;the general of our division, a very
good old gentleman.</p>

<p>Let us go into the public room, and have breakfast;
for it is half-past nine o'clock, and the bell has rung.
There are not more than half a dozen at the table.
These are the early risers who walk or ride round the
Camel's Back every morning: the Camel's Back being
a huge mountain, encircled about its middle by a good
road. The majority of the club's members are asleep,
and will defer breakfast until tiffin time&mdash;half-past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
two. At that hour the gathering will be great.
How these early risers eat, to be sure! There is the
major, who, if you believe him, has every complaint
mentioned in "Graham's Domestic Medicine," has
just devoured two thighs (grilled) of a turkey, and is
now asking Captain Blossom's opinion of the Irish
stew, while he is cutting into a pigeon-pie.</p>

<p>Let us now while away the morning. Let us call
on some of the grass widows. There are lots of them
here, civil and military. Let us go first to Mrs.
Merrydale, the wife of our old friend Charley, of the
two hundredth and tenth regiment. Poor fellow!
He could not get leave, and the doctors said another
hot summer in the plains would be the death of his
wife. They are seven hundred pounds in debt to the
Agra bank, and are hard put to it to live and pay the
monthly instalments of interest. Charley is only a
lieutenant. What terrible infants are these little
Merrydales! There is Lieutenant Maxwell's pony
under the trees, and if these children had not shouted
out, "Mamma! Mamma! here is Captain Wall,
Sahib!" I should have been informed that Mrs.
Merrydale was not at home, or was poorly, which I
should have believed implicitly. (Maxwell, when a
young ensign, was once engaged to be married to
Julia Dacey, now Mrs. Merrydale, but her parents
would not hear of it, for some reason or other.) As
it is, we must be admitted. We will not stay long.
Mrs. Merrydale is writing to her husband. Grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
widows in the hills are always writing to their husbands,
when you drop in upon them, and your presence
is not actually delighted in. How beautiful she
looks! now that the mountain breezes have chased
from her cheeks the pallor which lately clung to them
in the plains; and the fresh air has imparted to her
spirits an elasticity, in lieu of that languor by which
she was oppressed a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>Let us now go to Mrs. Hastings. She is the wife
of a civilian, who has a salary of fifteen hundred
rupees (one hundred and fifty pounds) per mensem,
and who is a man of fortune independent of his pay.
Mrs. Hastings has the best house in Mussoorie. She
is surrounded by servants. She has no less than
three Arab horses to ride. She is a great prude, is
Mrs. Hastings. She has no patience with married
women who flirt. She thinks that the dogma&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
When lovely women go astray,<br />
Their stars are more in fault than they&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>is all nonsense. Mrs. Hastings has been a remarkably
fine woman; she is now five-and-thirty, and still good
looking, though disposed to <i>embonpoint</i>. She wearies
one with her discourses on the duties of a wife. That
simpering cornet, Stammersleigh, is announced, and
we may bid her good morning.</p>

<p>The average rent for a furnished house is about five
hundred rupees (fifty pounds) for the six months.
Every house has its name. Yonder are Cocky Hall,
Belvidere, Ph&oelig;nix Lodge, the Cliffs, the Crags, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Vale, the Eagle's Nest, &amp;c. The value of these properties
ranges from five hundred to fifteen hundred
pounds. The furniture is of the very plainest description,
with one or two exceptions, and is manufactured
chiefly at Bareilly, and carried here on men's shoulders
the entire distance&mdash;ninety miles.</p>

<p>Where shall we go now, for it wants an hour to
tiffin time? Oh! here comes a janpan! (a sort of
sedan-chair carried by four hill men, dressed in loose
black clothes, turned up with red, yellow, blue, green,
or whatever colour the proprietor likes best). And in
the janpan sits a lady&mdash;Mrs. Apsley, a very pretty,
good-tempered, and well-bred little woman. She is
the grand-daughter of an English peer, and is very
fond of quoting her aunts and her uncles. "My aunt
Lady Mary Culnerson," "my aunt the Countess of
Tweedleford," "my uncle, Lord Charles Banbury
Cross," &amp;c. But that is her only weakness, I believe;
and, perhaps, it is ungenerous to allude to it. Her
husband is in the Dragoons.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Apsley, whither art thou going? To
pay visits?"</p>

<p>"No. I am going to Mrs. Ludlam's to buy a new
bonnet, and not before I want one, you will say."</p>

<p>"May I accompany you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and assist me in making a choice."</p>

<p>There is not a cloud to be seen. The air is soft
and balmy. The wild flowers are in full bloom, and
the butterfly is on the wing. The grasshopper is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
singing his ceaseless song, and the bees are humming
a chorus thereto.</p>

<p>We are now at Mrs. Ludlam's. The janpan is
placed upon the ground, and I assist Mrs. Apsley to
step from it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ludlam is the milliner and dressmaker of
Upper India, and imports all her wares direct from
London and Paris. Everybody in this part of the
world knows Mrs. Ludlam, and everybody likes her.
She has by industry, honesty of purpose, and economy,
amassed a little fortune; and has brought up a large
family in the most respectable and unpretending style.
Some people say that she sometimes can afford to sell
a poor ensign's wife a bonnet, or a silk dress, at a
price which hardly pays. What I have always admired
in Mrs. Ludlam is that she never importunes
her customers to buy her goods; nor does she puff
their quality.</p>

<p>The bonnet is bought; likewise a neck-scarf for
Jack. And we are now returning: Mrs. Apsley to
her home, and I to the club. Mrs. Apsley invites me
to dine with them; but that is impossible. It is
public night, and I have two guests. One of them
is Jack, who does not belong to the club, because
Mary does not wish it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Apsley says she wants some pickles, and we
must go into Ford's shop to purchase them. Ford
sells everything; and he is a wine, beer, and spirit
merchant. You may get anything at Ford's&mdash;guns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pistols, swords, whips, hats, clothes, tea, sugar, tobacco.
What is this which Ford puts into my hand? A
raffle paper! "To be raffled for, a single-barrelled
rifle, by Purdey. The property of a gentleman hard-up
for money, and in great difficulties. Twenty-five
chances at one gold mohur (one pound twelve shillings)
each."</p>

<p>"Yes, put my name down for a chance, Ford."</p>

<p>"And Captain Apsley's, please," says the lady.</p>

<p>After promising Mrs. Apsley most faithfully that
I will not keep Jack later than half-past twelve, and
taking another look into those sweet eyes of hers, I
gallop away as fast as the pony can carry me. I am
late; there is scarcely a vacant place at the long table.
We have no private tables. The same board shelters
the nether limbs of all of us. We are all intimate
friends, and know exactly each other's circumstances.
What a clatter of knives and forks! And what a
lively conversation! It alludes chiefly to the doings
of the past night. Almost every other man has a
nickname. To account for many of them would indeed
be a difficult, if not a hopeless task.</p>

<p>"Dickey Brown! Glass of beer?"</p>

<p>"I am your man," responds Major George, N. I.
Fencibles.</p>

<p>At the other end of the table you hear the word
"Shiney" shouted out, and responded to by Lieutenant
Fenwick of the Horse Artillery.</p>

<p>"Billy! Sherry?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Adolphus Bruce of the Lancers lifts his glass with
immense alacrity.</p>

<p>It is a curious characteristic of Indian society that
very little outward respect is in private shown to
seniority. I once heard an ensign of twenty years of
age address a civilian of sixty in the following terms:
"Now then, old moonsiff, pass that claret, please."</p>

<p>The tiffin over, a gool, or lighted ball of charcoal,
is passed round the table in a silver augdan (fire-holder).
Every man present lights a cigar, and in a
few minutes there is a general move. Some retire to
the billiard-room, others cluster round the fireplace;
others pace the platform; and two sets go up-stairs
into the reading-room to have a quiet rubber&mdash;from
three till five. Those four men seated at the table near
the window have the reputation of being the best players
in India. The four at the other table know very little of
the game of whist. Mark the difference! The one set
never speak, except when the cards are being dealt.
The other set are finding fault with one another
during the progress of the hand. The good players
are playing high. Gold mohur points&mdash;five gold
mohurs on the rub&mdash;give and take five to two after
the first game. And sometimes, at game and game,
they bet an extra five. Tellwell and Long, who are
playing against Bean and Fickle, have just lost a
bumper&mdash;twenty-seven gold mohurs&mdash;a matter of
forty-three pounds four shillings.</p>

<p>In the billiard-room, there is a match going on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
between four officers who are famed for their skill,
judgment, and execution. Heavy bets are pending.
How cautiously and how well they play! No wonder,
when we consider the number of hours they practise,
and that they play every day of their lives. That tall
man, now about to strike, makes a revenue out of
billiards. I shall be greatly mistaken if that man
does not come to grief some day. He preys upon
every youngster in every station he goes to with his
regiment. He is a captain in the Native Infantry.
His name is Tom Locke. He has scored forty-seven
off the red ball. His confederate, Bunyan, knows full
well that luck has little to do with his success. He,
too, will come to grief before long. Your clever villains
are invariably tripped up sooner or later, and
ignominiously stripped of their commissions and positions
in society.</p>

<p>It is five o'clock. Some thirty horses and as many
ponies are saddled and bridled, and led up and down
in the vicinity of the club. Everybody will be on the
mall presently. The mall is a part of the road round
the Camel's Back. It is a level of about half a mile
long and twelve feet broad. A slight fence stands
between the riders and a deep khud (precipice). To
gallop along this road is nothing when you are accustomed
to it; but at first it makes one very nervous even
to witness it. Serious and fatal accidents have happened;
but, considering all things, they have been far
fewer than might have been expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The mall is crowded. Ladies and gentlemen on
horseback, and ladies in janpans&mdash;the janpanees
dressed in every variety of livery. Men in the French
grey coats, trimmed with white serge, are carrying
Mrs. Hastings. Men in the brown clothes, trimmed
with yellow serge, are carrying Mrs. Merrydale.
Jack Apsley's wife is mounted on her husband's
second charger. "Come along, Captain Wall," she
calls out to me, and goes off at a canter, which soon
becomes a hard gallop. I follow her of course. Jack
remains behind, to have a quiet chat with Mrs. Flower,
of his regiment; who thinks&mdash;and Jack agrees with
her&mdash;that hard riding on the mall is a nuisance, and
ought to be put a stop to. But, as we come back, we
meet the hypocrite galloping with a Miss Pinkerton,
a new importation, with whom&mdash;much to the amusement
of his wife&mdash;he affects to be desperately in
love. The mall, by the way, is a great place for
flirtations.</p>

<p>Most steady-going people, like Mrs. Flower, not
only think hard riding on the mall a nuisance, but
make it the theme of letters to the editors of the
papers; and sometimes the editors will take the
matter up, and write leading articles thereon, and
pointedly allude to the fact&mdash;as did the late Sir C. J.
Napier in a general order&mdash;that beggars on horseback
usually ride in the opposite direction to heaven.
But these letters and leaders rarely have the desired
effect; for what can a man do when a pretty woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
like Mrs. Apsley says, "Come along; let us have a
gallop."</p>

<p>Why are there so very many people on the mall
this evening? A few evenings ago it was proposed at
the club that a band should play twice a week. A
paper was sent round at once, and every one subscribed
a sum in accordance with his means. Next
morning the required number of musicians was hunted
up and engaged. Two cornets, two flutes, two violins,
a clarionet, a fife, and several drums. It is the twenty-ninth
of May&mdash;a day always celebrated in "this great
military camp," as Lord Ellenborough described
British India. At a given signal, the band strikes
up "God save the Queen." We all flock round the
band, which has taken up a position on a rock
beetling over the road. The male portion of us raise
our hats, and remain uncovered while the anthem is
played. We are thousands of miles distant from our
fatherland and our Queen, but our hearts are as true
and as loyal as though she were in the midst of us.</p>

<p>This is the first time that the Himalaya mountains
have listened to the joyous sound of music. We have
danced to music within doors; but never, until this
day, have we heard a band in the open air in the
Himalaya mountains. How wonderful is the effect!
From valley to valley echo carries the sound, until at
last it seems as though</p>

<div class="poem">
Every mountain now had found a band.<br />
</div>

<p>Long after the strain has ceased with us, we can hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
it penetrating into and reverberating amidst regions
which the foot of man has never yet trodden, and
probably will never tread. The sun has gone down,
but his light is still with us.</p>

<p>Back to the club! Dinner is served. We sit
down, seventy-five of us. The fare is excellent, and
the champagne has been iced in the hail which fell
the other night, during a storm. Jack Apsley is on
my right, and I have thrice begged of him to remember
that he must not stay later than half-past twelve;
and he has thrice responded that Mary has given him
an extension of leave until daylight. Jack and I
were midshipmen together, some years ago, in a line-of-battle
ship that went by the name of the House of
Correction. And there is Wywell sitting opposite to
us&mdash;Wywell who was in the frigate which belonged
to our squadron&mdash;the squadron that went round the
world, and buried the commodore, poor old Sir
James! in Sydney churchyard. Fancy we three
meeting again in the Himalaya mountains!</p>

<p>The cloth is removed, for the dinner is over. The
president of the club&mdash;the gentleman who founded it&mdash;rises.
He is a very little man of seventy years of
age&mdash;fifty-three of which have been spent in India.
He is far from feeble, and is in full possession of all
his faculties. His voice is not loud, but it is very
distinct, and pierces the ear.</p>

<p>They do not sit long after dinner at the club. It
is only nine, and the members are already diminishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Some are off to the billiard-room, to smoke,
drink brandy-and-water, and look on at the play.
The whist parties are now at work, and seven men
are engaged at brag. A few remain; and, drawing
their chairs to the fireplace, form a ring and chat
cosily.</p>

<p>Halloa! what is this? The club-house is heaving
and pitching like a ship at anchor in a gale of wind.
Some of us feel qualmish. It is a shock of an earthquake;
and a very violent shock. It is now midnight.
A thunderstorm is about to sweep over
Mussoorie. Only look at that lurid forked lightning
striking yonder hill, and listen to that thunder!
While the storm lasts, the thunder will never for a
second cease roaring; for, long before the sound of
one peal has died away, it will be succeeded by
another more awful. And now, look at the Dhoon!
Those millions of acres are illuminated by incessant
sheet lightning. How plainly we discern the trees
and the streams in the Dhoon, and the outline of the
pass which divides the Dhoon from the plains. What
a glorious panorama! We can see the black clouds
descending rapidly towards the Dhoon, and it is not
until they near that level land that they discharge
the heavy showers with which they are laden. What
a luxury would this storm be to the inhabitants of
the plains; but it does not extend beyond the
Dhoon. We shall hear the day after to-morrow that
not a single drop of rain has fallen at Umballah,
Meerut, or Saharunpore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The party from the billiard-room has come up to
have supper, now that the storm is over. They are
rather noisy; but the card-players take no heed of
them. They are too intent upon their play to be disturbed.
Two or three of the brag party call for
oyster-toast to be taken to the table, and they devour
it savagely while the cards are dealt round, placing
their lighted cheroots meanwhile on the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>And now there is singing&mdash;comic and sentimental.
"Isle of Beauty" is followed by the "Steam Leg,"
the "Steam Leg" by the "Queen of the May," the
"Queen of the May" by the facetious version of
"George Barnwell," and so on. Jack Apsley&mdash;who
has ascertained that dear Mary is quite safe, and not
at all alarmed&mdash;is still here, and is now singing "Rule,
Britannia," with an energy and enthusiasm which
are at once both pleasing and ridiculous to behold.
He has been a soldier for upwards of sixteen years;
but the sailor still predominates in his nature; while
his similes have invariably reference to matters connected
with ships and the sea. He told me just now,
that when he first joined his regiment, he felt as
much out of his element as a live dolphin in a sentry-box,
and he has just described his present colonel as
a man who is as touchy as a boatswain's kitten.
Apsley's Christian name is Francis, but he has always
been called Jack, and always will be.</p>

<p>It is now broad daylight, and high time for a man
on sick-leave to be in bed. How seedy and disreputable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
we all look, in our evening dresses and patent-leather
boots. And observe this carnation in my
button-hole&mdash;the gift of Mrs. Apsley; she gave it to
me on the mall. The glare of the lights, and the
atmosphere of smoke in which I have been sitting
part of the night, have robbed it of its freshness, its
bloom, and perfume. I am sorry to say it is an
emblem of most of us.</p>

<p>Go home, Apsley! Go home, reeking of tobacco-smoke
and brandy-and-water&mdash;with your eyes like
boiled gooseberries, your hair in frightful disorder&mdash;go
home! You will probably meet upon the mall
your three beautiful children, with their rosy faces
all bloom, and their breath, when they press their
glowing lips to those feverish cheeks of yours, will
smell as incense, and make you ashamed of yourself.
Go home, Jack. I will tiff with you to-day at half-past
two.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two young gentlemen were victimized last night
at the brag party. The one, a lieutenant of the
N. I. Buffs, lost six thousand rupees; the other, a
lieutenant of the Foot Artillery, four thousand. The
day after to-morrow, the first of the month, will be
settling day. How are they to meet these debts of
honour? They have nothing but their pay, and must
borrow from the banks. That is easily managed.
The money will be advanced to them on their own
personal security, and that of two other officers in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
service. They must also insure their lives. The
premium and the interest together will make them
forfeit fourteen per cent. per annum on the sum
advanced. The loan will be paid off in three years,
by monthly instalments. The paymaster will receive
an order from the bank secretary to deduct for the
bank so much per mensem from their pay. For the
next three years they will have to live very mildly
indeed.</p>

<p>There were also two victims (both youngsters) to
billiards. One lost three thousand rupees in bets,
another two thousand five hundred by bad play.
They too, will have to fly for assistance to the banks.
Captains Locke and Bunyan won, between them, last
night, one thousand four hundred pounds. There
was but little execution done at whist. Not more
than one hundred and fifty pounds changed hands.
Those four men who play regularly together, and who
never exceed their usual bets, have very little difference
between them at the end of each month&mdash;not
thirty pounds either way. This will not hurt them;
for they have all good appointments, and have private
property besides.</p>

<p>I find, on going to tiffin at Jack Apsley's, that
Mrs. Jack has heard all about the winnings and
losings at the club. Some man went home and told
his wife, and she has told everybody whom she has
seen. In a short time the news will travel to head-quarters
at Simlah, and out will come a general order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on gambling, which general order will be read aloud
at the Himalaya Club, with comments by the whole
company&mdash;comments which will be received with
shouts of laughter. Some youngsters will put the
general order into verse, and send it to a newspaper.
This done, the general order will be converted into
pipe-lights. This is no doubt very sad; but I have
no time to moralize. My duty is simply to paint the
picture.</p>

<p>Mrs. Apsley is not angry with her husband for
staying up till daylight. She thinks a little dissipation
does him good; and it is but a very little that
Jack indulges in, for he is a good husband and a
good father. Jack has a severe headache, but he
won't confess it. He says he never touched the
champagne, and only drank two glasses of brandy
and water. But who ever did touch the champagne,
and who ever did drink any more than two glasses of
brandy and water? Jack came home with his
pockets filled with almonds, raisins, prunes, nutcrackers,
and two liqueur glasses; but how they got
there he has not the slightest idea&mdash;but I have.
Wywell, from a sideboard, was filling his pockets all
the while he was singing "Rule, Britannia."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Apsley, I have some news for you."</p>

<p>"What is it, Captain Wall?"</p>

<p>"The club gives a ball on the 7th of June."</p>

<p>"You don't say so."</p>

<p>"And what is more, a fancy ball."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The tiffin is brought in. Mulligatawny soup and
rice, cold lamb and mint sauce, sherry and beer.
The Apsleys are very hospitable people; but Mary,
who rules the household, never exceeds her means for
the sake of making a display.</p>

<p>The soup and a glass of wine set Jack up; and he
becomes quite chirpy. He proposes that he and I
and Wywell shall go to the fancy ball as middies,
and that Mary shall appear as Black-eyed Susan.
Then, darting off at a tangent, he asks me if I remember
when we were lying off Mount Edgecombe,
just before sailing for South America? But he
requires a little more stimulant, for the tears are
glistening in his soft blue eyes when he alludes to
the death of poor Noel, a middy whom we buried in
the ocean a few days before we got to Rio. In a
very maudlin way he narrates to his wife the many
excellent qualities of poor Noel. She listens with
great attention; but, observing that his spontaneous
emotion is the result of the two over-night glasses of
brandy&mdash;plus what he cannot remember drinking
over-night&mdash;she suggests that Jack shall make some
sherry cobbler. What a jewel of a woman art thou,
Mrs. Apsley! Several of the men who returned
home, as Jack did, none the better for their potations,
have been driven by their wives' reproaches to the
club, where they are now drinking brandy and soda-water
to excess; while here is your spouse as comfortable
as a cricket on a hearth; and now that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
confesses he was slightly screwed, you, with quiet
tact, contradict his assertion.</p>

<p>For the next week the forthcoming fancy ball to
be given by the club will be the chief topic of conversation
amongst the visitors at Mussoorie. Mrs.
Ludlam is in immense demand. She knows the
character that each lady will appear in; but it is
useless to attempt to extract from her the slightest
particle of information on that head. This ball will
be worth seven hundred and fifty rupees to Mrs.
Ludlam.</p>

<p>Let us keep away from the club for a few days;
for, after several officers have been victimized at play,
their friends are apt to talk about the matter in an
unpleasant manner. This frequently leads to a quarrel,
which I dislike to witness.</p>

<p>Where shall we go? To the Dhoon. It is very
hot there; but never mind. No great-coat, no fires,
an hour hence; but the very lightest of garments
and a punkah. The thermometer is at eighty-five
degrees there. The Dhoon is not a healthy place in
the summer. It must have been the bed of an enormous
lake, or small inland sea. Its soil being
alluvial, will produce anything: every kind of fruit,
European and tropical. You may gather a peach
and a plantain out of the same garden. Some of the
hedges in this part of the world are singularly
beautiful, composed of white and red cluster roses
and sweetbriers. There is an excellent hotel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Dhoon, where we are sure to meet people whom we
know.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I find a Party of five at the hotel;
all club men, and intimate friends of mine. They,
too, have come down to avoid being present on the
first settling day; for if there should be any duelling,
it is just possible that some of us might be asked to
act as second.</p>

<p>We must dine off sucking-pig in the Dhoon. The
residents at Mussoorie used to form their pig-parties
in the Dhoon, just as the residents of London form
their whitebait banquets at Greenwich. I once took
a French gentleman, who was travelling in India, to
one of these pig-parties, and he made a very humorous
note of it in his book of travel, which he showed
to me. Unlike most foreigners who travel in English
dominions, he did not pick out and note down
all the bad traits in our character; but gave us
credit for all those excellent points which his experience
of mankind in general enabled him to
observe.</p>

<p>The Governor-General's body-guard is quartered
just now in the Dhoon, and there is a Goorkha regiment
here. The Dhoon will send some twenty
couples to the fancy ball on the 7th. Every lady
in the place has at this moment a Durzee (man
tailor) employed in her back verandah dress-making.
We are admitted to the confidence of Mrs. Plowville,
who is going as Norma. And a very handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Norma she will make; she being rather like Madame
Grisi&mdash;and she knows it.</p>

<p>We return to the club on the 2nd of June.
There has been a serious dispute, and a duel has been
fought; but happily, no blood shed. The intelligence
of the gambling at the club has reached the
Commander-in-Chief at Simlah; and he has ordered
that the remainder of the leave granted to Captains
Locke and Bunyan be cancelled, and that those
officers forthwith join their respective regiments.
The victims also have been similarly treated; yet
every one of these remanded officers came up here on
medical certificate.</p>

<p>It is the morning of the 7th of June. The
stewards of the ball are here, there, and everywhere,
making arrangements. Several old hands, who hate
and detest balls, and who voted against this ball, are
walking about the public room, protesting that it is
the greatest folly they ever heard of. And in their
disgust they blackball two candidates for admission
who are to be balloted for on the 10th instant.
They complain that they can get no tiffin, no dinner,
no anything. But the stewards only laugh at them.</p>

<p>The supper has been supplied by Monsieur Emille,
the French restaurateur, and a very splendid supper
it is. It is laid out in the dining-room. Emille is a
great artist. He is not perhaps equal to Brazier&mdash;that
great man whom Louis Philippe gave to his
friend, Lord William Bentinck, when Lord William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
was going out to govern India&mdash;but Emille, nevertheless,
would rank high even amongst the most
skilful of cuisiniers in Europe.</p>

<p>It is a quarter past nine, and we of the club are
ready to receive our guests. The ladies come in
janpans; their husbands following them on horseback
or on foot. It is a beautiful moonlight night.
We are always obliged to wait upon the moon when
we give a ball in Mussoorie. Before ten o'clock the
room is crowded. There are present one hundred
and thirty-six gentlemen, and seventy-five ladies.
Of the former nine-tenths are soldiers, the remainder
are civilians. Of the latter, seventy are married; the
remaining five are spinsters.</p>

<p>Here we all are in every variety of costume&mdash;Turks,
Greeks, Romans, Bavarian broom-girls,
Medoras, Corsairs, Hamlets, Othellos, Tells, Charles
the Seconds, and Quakers. Many have not come in
fancy costume, but in their respective uniforms; and
where do you see such a variety of uniforms as in an
Indian ball-room? Where will you meet with so
great a number of distinguished men? There is the
old general: that empty sleeve tells a tale of the
battle of Waterloo. Beside him is a general in the
Company's service, one who has recently received
the thanks of his country. He has seen seventy, but
there is no man in the room who could at this very
time endure so great an amount of mental or bodily
fatigue. That youngster to the right of the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is to be made a brevet-major and a C.B. as soon as
he gets his company. He is a hero, though a mere
boy. That pale-faced civilian is a man of great
ability, and possesses administrative talents of the
very highest order. Seated on an ottoman, talking
to Mrs. Hastings, is the famous Hawkins, of the
Third Dragoons. Laughing in the side doorway is
the renowned William Mumble. He is the <i>beau
ideal</i> of a dashing soldier. Yonder is Major Starcross,
whose gallantry in Affghanistan was the theme
of admiration in Europe. And there is Colonel
Bolt, of the Duke's Own. All of these men have
been under very hot fire&mdash;the hottest that even Lord
Hardinge could remember. All of them are decorated
with medals and ribbons. Where will you see
handsomer women than you frequently meet in a
ball-room at Mussoorie or Simlah? Amongst those
now assembled there are three who, at any court in
Europe, would be conspicuous for their personal
attractions&mdash;Mrs. Merrydale, Mrs. Plowville, and Mrs.
Banks. Mrs. Apsley is a pretty little woman; but
the three to whom I have alluded are beautiful.</p>

<p>The dancing has commenced, and will continue
until four o'clock, with an interval of half-an-hour at
supper-time. The second supper&mdash;the ladies being
gone&mdash;will then commence, and a very noisy party it
will be. Unrestrained by the presence of the fair
sex, the majority of those who remain will drink and
smoke in earnest, and the chances are, there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
several rows. Ensign Jenks, when the brandy and
water inflames him, will ask young Blackstone, of the
Civil Service, what he meant by coming up and
talking to his partner during the last set of quadrilles.
Blackstone will say, the lady beckoned to him. Jenks
will say, "It is a lie!" Blackstone will rise to assault
Jenks. Two men will hold Blackstone down on his
chair. The general will hear of this, for Captain
Lovelass (who is himself almost inarticulate) has said
to Jenks, "Cossider self unarrest!" Jenks will have
to join his regiment at Meerut, after receiving from
the general a very severe reprimand.</p>

<p>While talking over the past ball, an archery meeting
or a pic-nic is sure to be suggested. It must
originate at the club; without the countenance of the
club, which is very jealous of its prerogative, no
amusement can possibly be successful. A lady, the
wife of a civilian, who prided herself on her husband's
lofty position, had once the temerity to try the experiment,
and actually sent round a proposal-paper
in her own handwriting, and by one of her own
servants. She failed of course. All the club people
wrote the word "seen" opposite to their names; but
withheld the important word "approved." Even the
tradespeople at Mussoorie acknowledge the supremacy
of the Himalaya Club.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The season is over. The cold weather has commenced
in the plains. It is the 5th of October, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
everybody at Mussoorie is on the move&mdash;going down
the hill, as it is called. Every house which was lately
full is now empty, and will remain so till the coming
April. The only exceptions will be the schools for
young ladies and for little boys; the convent, the
branch of the North-West Bank, and the Post-Office.
Invalided officers who reside at the sanatarium during
the summer will go down the hill, and winter in
Deyrah Dhoon. In another month the mountains
will be covered with snow, and it would be dangerous
to walk out on these narrow roads, few of which are
railed in.</p>

<p>Let us sum up the events of the season. Four
young men were victimized&mdash;two at cards and two at
billiards. Two duels were fought on the day after
the ball. In one of these duels an officer fell dead.
In another the offending party grievously wounded
his antagonist. Four commissions were sacrificed in
consequence of these encounters. There were two
elopements. Mrs. Merrydale went off with Lieutenant
Maxwell, leaving her children under the care of the
servants, until her husband came to take them away.
Mrs. Hastings, who used to bore us about the duties
of a wife, carried off that silly boy Stammersleigh.
These elopements led to two actions in H.M. Supreme
Court of Calcutta, and seven of us (four in one case
and three in the other) had to leave our regiments or
appointments, and repair to the Supreme Court to
give evidence. Some of us had to travel fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hundred miles in the month of May, the hottest
month in India.</p>

<p>There was another very awkward circumstance
connected with that season at Mussoorie. The reader
knows that Captains Locke and Bunyan were ordered
to join their regiments, the unexpired portion of their
leave having been cancelled by order of his Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief. In the hurry of his departure
from the hills, Locke had left in the drawer
of a table a letter from Bunyan, containing a proposal
to victimize a certain officer&mdash;then in Mussoorie&mdash;in
the same manner that they had victimized one Lord
George Straw; namely, to get him to their rooms,
and play at brag. Lord George Straw had lost to
these worthies eighteen hundred pounds on one
eventful night. The general opinion was, touching a
very extraordinary fact connected with the play, that
Lord George had been cheated. This letter from
Bunyan to Locke was found by the servant of the
officer who now occupied the apartments recently
vacated by Locke. The servant handed it to his
master, who, fancying that it was one of his own
letters, began abstractedly to read it. Very soon,
however, he discovered his mistake. But he had read
sufficient to warrant his reading the whole, and he
did so. A meeting of gentlemen at the club was
called; and, before long, Locke and Bunyan left the
army by sentence of a general court-martial. I have
since heard that Locke lost his ill-gotten gains in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Ireland, and became eventually a marker at a billiard-room;
and that Bunyan, who also came to poverty,
was seen driving a cab for hire in Oxford-street.</p>

<p>It behoves me, however, to inform the reader that,
recently, the tone of Anglo-Indian society during
the hot seasons is very much improved. Six or seven
years ago there never was a season that did not end
as unhappily as that which I have attempted to describe;
but it is now four years since I heard of a
duel in the Upper Provinces&mdash;upwards of four years
since I heard of a victim to gambling, and nearly
three since there was an elopement. It is true that
the records of courts-martial still occasionally exhibit
painful cases; but, if we compare the past with the
present, we must admit that the change is very satisfactory.
I do not attribute this altered state of things
to the vigilance of commanding officers, or the determination
of the commanders-in-chief to punish severely
those who offend. It is due chiefly to the improved
tone of society in England, from which country we
get our habits and manners. The improvement in
the tone of Indian society has been very gradual.
Twenty years ago India was famous for its infamy.
Ten years ago it was very bad. It is now tolerable.
In ten years from this date, if not in less time, Indian
society will be purged entirely of those evils which
now prey upon it, and trials for drunkenness and other
improper conduct will happen as rarely as in England.
Year by year this communication between our fatherland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and the upper part of India will become more
speedy and less expensive; and thus will a greater
number of officers be enabled to come home on furlough
for a year or two. Nothing does an Indian officer so
much good as a visit to Europe. When a man has
once contracted bad habits in India, he cannot reform
in India. To be cured he must be taken away for a
while from the country. There have been instances
of officers who have had strength of mind to alter
their course of life without leaving the East; but
those instances are very few.</p>

<p>The East India Company should do all in its power
to encourage young officers to spend a certain time
every seven years in Europe. Instead of six months'
leave to the hills&mdash;which six months are spent in
utter idleness, and too frequently in dissipation&mdash;give
them nine months' leave to Europe. This would
admit of their spending six months in England, or on
the Continent, where they would improve their minds
and mend their morals, as well as their constitutions.</p>

<p>The East India Company should also bring the
Peninsular and Oriental Company to reasonable terms
for the passage of officers to and from India. A lieutenant
who wishes to come home, cannot at present
get a passage from Calcutta to Southampton under
one hundred and twenty pounds. So that he gives
up more than four months' pay for being "kept"
thirty-six days on board of a steamer. Three pounds
ten shillings per diem for food and transit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE MAHOMMEDAN MOTHER.</h2>

<p>Mussoorie and Landour, situated in the lower range
of the Himalaya mountains, form the favourite sanitarium
of the upper part of India. The scenery is
more beautiful than that of Simlah; for Mussoorie and
Landour command a view of Dehra Dhoon, which
resembles (except that the Dhoon is grander and
more extensive) the plains of Italy as seen from the
ascent of the Simplon. The mall of Mussoorie is
crowded every evening with visitors; some on horseback,
some on hill ponies, some on foot, and some in
the janpan (something like a sedan-chair carried by
four hill men). A gayer scene it would be impossible
to conceive. Every one knows his neighbour; and,
in passing along the narrow road, stoppages are
frequent. Compliments must be exchanged, and the
news or scandal of the day gossiped about. Every
now and then you hear a cry of "What a shame!"
from a terrified lady in a janpan, while a couple of
lovers gallop past on spirited Arabs at full speed.
Sometimes a shriek from a nervous mamma reverberates
through the valleys, when she beholds her
children in the way of the heedless pair.</p>

<p>Accidents sometimes occur. A few years ago, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lady and a gentleman were riding round a place called
the Camel's Back; the road gave way, and they fell
down a precipice several hundred feet. The horses
were killed, but the riders miraculously escaped with
only a few severe bruises. On another occasion, a
gentleman of the civil service was taking his evening
walk, when one of his dogs ran between his legs, and
precipitated him. He was killed on the spot.</p>

<p>On the mall every evening was to be seen a native
woman standing by the side of the road, near a large
rock, watching those who passed by. She was well
dressed, and her face was concealed, according to the
custom of persons of her apparent station in life.
There she stood, attracting general attention. She
was a woman of slight, but graceful figure, and rather
tall. Many persons were curious to know who she
was, and to see her face; but she took care that in
this respect none should be gratified. Sometimes
she would go away early; at other times she would
remain until it was quite dark. Some suspected&mdash;and
I was amongst the number&mdash;that she was the
native wife of some European officer who had divorced
himself, and visited the "Hills," whither the woman,
to annoy, had followed him; and there was no small
amount of speculation as to whose wife she could be.
Some of the guesses, if they were seriously made,
were extremely ungenerous, for they included several
elderly officials, who could not by any possibility have
been married to this mysterious lady. I was determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to know who she was; and one night, when
most people were thronged around the band, I
approached her, and inquired if I could be of any
service to her. She replied (her face closely covered),
"Yes; by going away." She had a very sweet voice,
and its sorrowful tones inspired me with pity, when
she added, "I am a poor woman; my heart is crushed;
do not add to my misery by remaining near me." I
obeyed her, after apologizing for having intruded.
Several other persons had attempted to extract some
particulars from the lady, and had received the same
sort of reply as that she had given to me.</p>

<p>The rains were about to commence, and storms
were not unfrequent. The mall was less frequented;
only a few&mdash;those who cared little about hearing
"heaven's artillery thunder in the skies," or being
pelted by hailstones as large as marbles&mdash;ventured
out; but amongst that few was the native lady, who,
punctual as the light of day, visited that huge, dismal-looking
rock, and gazed upon the road.</p>

<p>I have seen a storm on the heights of Jura&mdash;such
a storm as Lord Byron describes. I have seen lightning
and heard thunder in Australia; I have, off
Terra del Fuego, the Cape of Good Hope, and the
coast of Java, kept watch in thunderstorms which
have drowned in their roaring the human voice, and
made every one deaf and stupified; but these storms
are not to be compared with a thunderstorm at
Mussoorie or Landour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of these storms of thunder, lightning, wind,
and hail, at about five o'clock in the afternoon, I laid
a wager with a friend that the native lady would be
found as usual standing near the rock. Something
secretly assured me that she was there at that moment,
looking on unmoved, except by the passions which
had prompted her pilgrimage. How were we to decide
it? "By going to the spot," I suggested. My
friend declined; but declared that, as far as the bet
was concerned, he would be perfectly satisfied with
my word, either one way or the other; namely,
whether I had won or lost.</p>

<p>I set off upon my journey. The rock was at least
three-quarters of a mile distant from my abode. My
curiosity was so much aroused&mdash;albeit I felt certain
the woman was there&mdash;that I walked through the
storm without heeding it. Every now and then I
saw the electric fluid descend into a valley; then
heard that strange noise which huge pieces of rock
make when they bound from one precipice to another,
tearing up trees, and carrying large stones and the
earth along with them in their headlong career; but
still my mind was intent on the woman, and nothing
else.</p>

<p>Was she there?</p>

<p>Yes; there she sat, drenched to the skin; but I
could not pity her wet and cold condition, for I could
see that she cared no more about it than I cared
about my own. She drew her garment so closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
over her face, that the outline of her features was
plainly discernible. It was decidedly handsome; but
still I longed to see her eyes, to confirm my impression.
I sat beside her. The storm still raged,
and presently the lady said, "The heaven is speaking,
Sahib." I answered, "Truly; but the lightning, the
parent of that sound which I now hear, I cannot see."
She understood me, and gave me a glimpse of her
eyes. They were not like the eyes of a native; they
were of a bluish hue, almost grey. I said to her, in
Hindoostanee, "You are not a native; what do you
do here in a native dress?"</p>

<p>"I would I were an European," she answered me.
"My feelings, perhaps, would be less acute, and I
should be sitting over a bright fire. Oh, how loudly
the heaven is speaking! Go home, Sahib, you will
catch cold!"</p>

<p>"Why do <i>you</i> not go home?" I asked. "You
will see no one to-day. No&mdash;not even your beloved.
I am the only being who will venture out in a storm
like this; and I do so only for your sake."</p>

<p>"My heart is as hard as this rock," she said, flipping
her finger against the granite, "to all except one
being&mdash;a child. Oh, how the heaven is speaking,
Sahib!"</p>

<p>"Do you not fear the lightning and the hail?" I
asked her.</p>

<p>"I did once," she replied. "I trembled whenever
it came near; but now, what does it signify? <i>Bidglee</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
(lightning), come to me," she cried, beckoning to a
streak of fluid which entered the ground within a
hundred yards of us. "<i>Bidglee</i>, come here, and make
a turquoise of my heart."</p>

<p>What pretty feet! She had kicked off her shoes,
which were saturated and spoiled.</p>

<p>"Go home, Sahib" (such was the refrain of her
conversation); "you will catch cold!"</p>

<p>By degrees I had an opportunity of seeing all her
features. She was most beautiful, but had evidently
passed the meridian of her charms. She could not
have been less than twenty-four years of age. On the
forefinger of her left hand she wore a ring of English
manufacture, in which was set a red cornelian, whereon
was engraved a crest&mdash;a stag's head.</p>

<p>I took her hand in mine, and said, "Where did
you get this?" pointing to the ring.</p>

<p>She smiled and sighed, and then answered, "Jee
(sir), it belonged to an Ameer (a great man)."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Never mind."</p>

<p>"Do you expect to see him soon?"</p>

<p>"No; never."</p>

<p>"Is he old?"</p>

<p>"No; not older than yourself. How the heaven
is speaking!"</p>

<p>"Let me see you to your home."</p>

<p>"No. I will go alone."</p>

<p>"When do you intend to go?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"When you have left me."</p>

<p>"You are very unkind thus to repulse my civility."</p>

<p>"It may be so; but my heart's blood is curdled."</p>

<p>I bade her farewell; and through the storm, which
still raged, I went home and won my wager.</p>

<p>I could not rest that night. The beautiful face of
the native woman haunted me. In vain I tried to
sleep, and at last I arose from my bed, and joined a
card-party, in the hope that the excitement of gambling
would banish her from my brain. But to no
purpose. I knew not what I was playing, and ere
long I left off in disgust.</p>

<p>Almost every one who visits the Hills keeps a
servant called a <i>tindal</i>. His duty is to look after
the men who carry your janpan, to go errands, to
keep up the fire, and to accompany you with a lantern
when you go out after dark. These tindals, like the
couriers on the Continent, are a peculiar race; and,
generally speaking, are a very sharp, active, and
courageous people. I summoned my tindal, and interrogated
him about the native lady who had caused
so much sensation in Mussoorie. The only information
he could afford me was, that she had come from
a village near Hurdwar; that she was rich, possessed
of the most costly jewels, kept a number of servants,
moved about in great state on the plains, and, for all
he knew, she might be the wife or slave of some
Rajah.</p>

<p>Could she, I wondered, be the famous Ranee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Chunda, the mother of Dulleep Singh, and the wife
of Runjeet?&mdash;the woman who, disguised as a soldier,
had escaped from the fort of Chunar, where she had
been imprisoned for disturbing, by her plots, the
imagination of Sir Frederick Currie, when he was
Resident at Lahore? The woman I had seen and
spoken to "answered to the description" of the Ranee
in every respect, excepting the eyes. Dulleep Singh
was living at Mussoorie, and he not unfrequently rode
upon the mall. Ranee Chunda had a satirical tongue,
and a peculiarly sweet-toned, but shrill voice, and she
had remarkably beautiful feet, and so had this woman.
Ranee Chunda had courage which was superhuman;
so had this woman. Ranee Chunda had a child&mdash;an
only child; so had this woman.</p>

<p>I asked the tindal where the lady lived. He replied,
that she occupied a small house near the
bazaar, not very far from my own abode. "She is in
great grief," the tindal yawned, "about something or
other."</p>

<p>"Endeavour to find out the cause of her misfortunes,"
said I, "and you shall be rewarded according
to your success."</p>

<p>Next day the tindal reported to me that I was not
the only Sahib who was deeply interested in the
native lady's affairs; that many wished to make her
acquaintance, and had sent their tindals to talk to
her; but that she had firmly and laconically dismissed
them all, just as she had dismissed him&mdash;"Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
your master that the sufferings of an object of
pity, such as I am, ought not to be aggravated by
the insulting persecution of gay and light-hearted
men."</p>

<p>The day after the storm brought forth the loveliest
afternoon that can be imagined. The sun shone out
brightly, the clouds were lifted from the Dhoon, and
the vast panorama resembled what we read of in some
fairy tale. All Mussoorie and Landour turned out.
The mall was so crowded, that it was difficult to
thread one's way through the throng.</p>

<p>Was the lady at the rock? Yes; there she stood,
as usual, watching those who passed. The Maharajah
with his suite appeared. I was convinced that the
woman was the Maharajah's mother; but I did not
breathe my suspicions, lest I might cause her to be
arrested. When it became dusk, and the visitors
were taking their departure, I again approached the
lady, and made my "salaam," in that respectful
phrase which is always adopted when addressing a
native woman of rank. She at once recognised me
as the person who had spoken to her during the
storm on the previous afternoon, for she alluded to
its fury, and said she had taken a wrong road, had
lost her way after I had left her, and did not reach
home till nearly midnight. She concluded her
little speech with a hope that I had been more fortunate.</p>

<p>"You should have allowed me to escort you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
said I. "I would have helped to carry your load of
sorrow."</p>

<p>She looked at me, and suddenly and abruptly said,
"Your name is Longford."</p>

<p>"You are right," said I.</p>

<p>"About three or four years ago you stayed for
several days with a friend in a tent near Deobund?
You were on your way to these mountains?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"You had a little dog with you, and you lost it at
Deobund?"</p>

<p>"I did lose my dog, and made a great noise about
it. But how do you know all this?"</p>

<p>She smiled and sighed.</p>

<p>I was bewildered. My belief that she was the
Ranee Chunda was almost confirmed. It was close
to the encampment of the Ranee, when she was on
her way to Chunar, that my dog was lost, and my
servants and the officers of police declared that it
must have been some of the Ranee's people who had
stolen the favourite.</p>

<p>"The dog is still alive," said the lady; "and if
you will come to-morrow, at twelve o'clock, to my
house, you shall see him; but you will promise not
to take him from me?"</p>

<p>"Of course I will not take him from you. But let
me see him to-night, and tell me how he came into
your possession. I will see you to your home."</p>

<p>"No, Sahib; be patient. I will tell you all to-morrow;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and, when you have heard my story, you
will perhaps do me a kindness. It is in your power
to assist me. Tell me where you live, and I will send
my brother to you at eleven o'clock. He will conduct
you to my house. Salaam, Sahib."</p>

<p>I returned her salaam, and left her.</p>

<p>I did not go to bed till two o'clock the next
morning, and when my tindal aroused me at eleven,
and informed me that a young man wished to see
me, I was disposed to believe that my engagement
at twelve had been made in my dreams.</p>

<p>I ordered the young man to be admitted. He
came to my bedside, and said in a confidential tone
of voice: "The lady has sent me to wait your commands."
I got up, made a hasty toilet, drank a cup
of very hot tea, and followed the young man, who
led me to the little house near the theatre, at the top
of the Bazaar. I entered the abode, and found the
lady sitting, native fashion, on a carpet on which was
strewed marigold and rose leaves. Her silver kulean
(small hookah) was beside her; and, sure enough,
there was my long-lost terrier, Duke, looking as sleek,
fat, lazy, and useless as a native lady's dog could be.
After expressing my thanks to the lady for her condescension
in granting me the interview, I spoke to
my former favourite, Duke, but he only stretched
himself, and yawned in reply.</p>

<p>"And you have still that ring with the blue stone
in it," said the lady, taking my hand, and smiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
while she looked at the ring. "I remember observing
this when I saw you asleep, one morning, on a
couch in the tent at Deobund. Had I noticed it when
you addressed me during the storm, I would not have
spoken so rudely to you."</p>

<p>"I do not remember having seen you previous to
the other evening," said I; "and if I had, I should
never have forgotten it. Where have we met?" I
repeated.</p>

<p>"Where I had opportunities of seeing you, but
where you could not see me."</p>

<p>There was an old serving woman, whom she called
mother, attending upon her, and the young man
whom she called brother, a soldier-like looking youth,
was still standing in the room to which he had conducted
me. The lady desired them both to withdraw,
and then begged me to bring the mora (or
stool) upon which I was sitting close to her side.
I obeyed her. She placed her finely-formed head in
the palms of her hands, and gave vent to a violent
flood of tears. I suffered her to weep without interruption.
Grief appeared to relieve her rather than
to increase her pain. At length she dried her eyes,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My father was a <i>Moolvee</i> (Mahommedan law
officer), attached to the Sudder Court, in Agra. I
am his only daughter. He was absent from home all
day. Why should he not be? He was paid for it;
he ate the Company's salt. Well, when I was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
fifteen years of age I was enticed away from my home
by the <i>Kotwall</i> (native police officer). He sent an old
woman, who had silver on her tongue and gold in her
hand. She told me long stories about love; and
promised me that if I left my home I should marry
the <i>Kotwall's</i> son, who was young and handsome. I
was but a child and very foolish. The servants who
had charge of me were all bribed heavily. One received
three hundred rupees, another two hundred, a
third one hundred. These people encouraged me in
the idea that to marry the <i>Kotwall's</i> son would be
the most prudent thing in the world; and, one day,
when my father had gone to the Court at about ten
o'clock, I eloped with the old woman whom the <i>Kotwall</i>
had sent to talk me over.</p>

<p>"We travelled all day in a <i>bylee</i> (native carriage),
guarded by two sowars. I asked the old woman
several times where she was taking me, but her only
reply was, 'Set your heart at rest, child, and eat some
sweetmeats.' The <i>pawn</i> which she gave me must
have been drugged, for shortly after eating it I fell
asleep. How long I slept I cannot say, but when I
awoke I found myself in the house of a Sahib. The
old woman was there also. I became alarmed, but
my fears were quieted by the old woman's tongue.
She told me I was close to Agra, but the truth was,
I was one hundred koss (two hundred miles) distant.
Nautch girls were sent for, and they danced before
me. I had this hookah given to me, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bangles. A boy very handsomely dressed waited
upon me, and brought my food. Parrots, minahs,
and doves were purchased for me to play with.
Whatever my childish fancy dictated the old woman
instantly procured.</p>

<p>"I was so constantly amused, I had no time or inclination
to think of my home. My father was a bad-tempered
man, and I was only too glad to be out of
hearing of the quarrels in which he constantly engaged
with his servants and dependents. One evening
the old woman said to me, '<i>Baba</i> (child), order a
Nautch this evening, and let me, in your name, invite
the Sahib to witness it.' I had never seen an
Englishman&mdash;an European&mdash;except at a distance.
The idea of being in the room with one inspired me
with terror. I had been taught to despise the Kafir,
whom my father said he was compelled to serve. I
objected; but the old woman's eloquence again prevailed.</p>

<p>"The night came; I was seated on my <i>fureesh</i>
(carpet) just as I am now, and dressed in clothes of
the gayest description. I was like a little queen, and
felt as proud as was Noor Jehan. I was then very
handsome. If I had not been, much trouble would
have been spared; and my flesh was firm&mdash;not as it
is now. At about ten o'clock the Sahib made his
appearance. When he came into the room I was
ready to faint with alarm, and, turning my head
away, I clung to the old woman, and trembled from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
head to foot. '<i>Dhuro mut</i>' (do not fear), said the
Sahib; and then he reproved, but in a gentle voice,
the Nautch girls who were laughing loudly at me.
The old woman, too, bade me banish my fears. After
a while, I ventured to steal a look at the Sahib; and
again averted my face, and clung to the old woman.
The Sahib, after remaining a brief while, during
which he praised my beauty, retired, and I was once
more happy. 'There,' said the old woman, when he
was gone; 'you see the Sahib is not a wild beast
out of the jungles, but as gentle as one of your own
doves.'</p>

<p>"On the following day I heard the Sahib talking
in the next room; I peeped through the keyhole of
the door, and saw him seated at a table. The <i>nazir</i>
(head clerk) was standing beside him, reading. There
was a man in chains surrounded by <i>burkand√¢zes</i>
(guards) at the other end of the room, and a woman
was there giving her evidence. The Court-house was
undergoing some repairs, and the Sahib was carrying
on his magisterial duties in his dining-room. The man
in chains began to speak, and deny his guilt. The
Sahib called out, '<i>Choop!</i>' (Silence!) in a voice so
loud, that I involuntarily started back and shuddered.
The prisoner again addressed the Sahib, and
one of the <i>burkand√¢zes</i> dealt him a severe blow on
the head, accompanied by the words, '<i>Suer! Chor!</i>'
(Pig! Thief!) The case was deferred until the following
day, and the court closed at about four o'clock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in the afternoon, when the Sahib again paid me a
visit.</p>

<p>"I was now afraid to show my fears, lest the Sahib
should order me to be killed; and I therefore put on
a cheerful countenance, while my heart was quivering
in my breast. The Sahib spoke to me very kindly,
and I began to dread him less.</p>

<p>"In this way I spent a fortnight; and, at the end
of that time, I ventured to talk to the Sahib as
though I were his equal. It afforded me great
amusement to watch the administration of justice
through the keyhole; and, young as I was, I imbibed
a desire to have a share in the arbitrary power which
was daily exercised.</p>

<p>"One day, when the Sahib came into my room, I
began to talk to him about a case of which he had
just disposed. He laughed, and listened to my views
with great patience. I told him that the evidence
upon which the prisoner had been convicted was false
from beginning to end. He promised me that he
would reverse the sentence of imprisonment; and, in
the ecstasy of my joy at finding that I really had
some power, I was intoxicated and unconscious of
what I was doing. I suffered the Sahib's lips to touch
mine. No sooner had I done so than I felt a degraded
outcast, and I cried more bitterly than I have words to
describe. The Sahib consoled me, and said that his
God and his Prophet should be mine; and that in this
world and the next our destinies should be the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"From that day I was a wife unto him. I ruled
his household, and I shared his pleasures and his sorrows.
He was in debt; but, by reducing his expenses,
I soon freed him, for his pay was fifteen
hundred rupees a month. I suffered no one to rob
him, and caused the old woman, who was a great
thief and cheat, to be turned away. I loved him
with all my soul. I would rather have begged
with him than have shared the throne of Ackbar
Shah. When he was tired, I lulled him to sleep;
when he was ill, I nursed him; when he was angry, I
soon restored him to good-humour; and, when I saw
him about to be deceived by subordinates, I put him
on his guard. That he loved me I never had any
reason to doubt. He gave me his confidence, and I
never abused his trust."</p>

<p>"Who was the man?" I inquired; for I was in
doubt, although I suspected.</p>

<p>"Be patient, Sahib," she replied, and then resumed.
"At the end of two years I became a mother."</p>

<p>Here she gave vent to another flood of tears.</p>

<p>"The Sahib was pleased. The child seemed to
bind us more closely together. I loved the child; I
believe it was because it bore such a strong likeness
to its father. When the Sahib was away from me
on duty in the district, he seemed still by my side,
when I looked at the boy, who was as white as you
are."</p>

<p>"Is the child dead?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be patient, Sahib. When you passed through
Deobund, and stayed in the tent with your friend, my
child was two years old. I was the mistress of that
encampment at Deobund, and the wine you drank was
given out with this hand."</p>

<p>"How little do men know of each other!" I exclaimed;
"even those who are the most intimate! I
had not the least idea there was a lady in the camp,
I assure you."</p>

<p>"How angry with you was I," said she, "for keeping
the Sahib up so late. You talked together the
whole night long. Therefore I had no remorse when
I took your dog. Well, as you are aware, soon after
that the Sahib was seized with fever, from which he
recovered; but he was so shattered by the attack that
he was compelled to visit Europe, where you know&mdash;"
She paused.</p>

<p>A native woman will never, if she can avoid it,
speak of the death of a person whom she has loved.
I was aware of this, and bowed my head, touching my
forehead with both hands. The father of her child
had died on his passage to England.</p>

<p>"Before he left me," she continued, "he gave me
all that he possessed; his house and furniture; his
horses, carriage, plate; his shares in the bank; his
watch, his dressing-case, his rings;&mdash;everything was
given to me, and I own all to this hour. When I
heard the sad news I was heartbroken. Had it not
been for the child I would have starved myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
death; as it was, I took to opium and smoking
<i>bhung</i> (hemp). While I was in this state, my Sahib's
brother&mdash;the Captain Sahib&mdash;came, and took away
the boy; not by violence. I gave it to him. What
was the child to me then? I did not care. But the
old woman whom you heard me call my mother, who
now attends me, gradually weaned me from the desperation
in which I was indulging; and, by degrees, my
senses returned to me. I then began to ask about
my child, and a longing to see him came over me.
At first they told me he was dead; but when they
found I was resolved to destroy myself by intemperance,
they told me the truth; that the child was
living, and at school in these hills. I have come
hither to be near my child. I see him almost every
day, but it is at a distance. Sometimes he passes
close to where I stand, and I long to spring upon him
and to hug him to my breast, whereon in infancy his
head reposed. I pray that I could speak to him, give
him a kiss, and bless him; but he is never alone. He
is always playing with, or talking to, the other little
boys at the same school. It seems hard that he
should be so joyous while his own mother is so
wretched. Of what use to me is the property I have,
when I cannot touch or be recognised by my
own flesh and blood. You know the master of the
school?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you not ask him to allow my child to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
you? I could then see him once more, and speak
to him. You were a friend of his father, and the request
would not seem strange."</p>

<p>I felt myself placed in a very awkward position,
and would make no promise; but I told the woman
I would consider the matter, and let her know on the
following day, provided she would stay at home, and
not visit that rock upon the road any more. She
strove hard to extract from me a pledge that I
would yield to her request; but, difficult as it
was to deny her anything&mdash;she was still so beautiful
and so interesting&mdash;I would not commit myself,
and held to what I had in the first instance
stated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I paid a visit to the school at which my friend's
child had been placed by his uncle, a captain in the
East India Company's service. I saw some thirty
scholars, of all colours, on the play-ground; but I
soon recognised the boy whom I was so curious to see.
He was indeed very like his father, not only in face
and figure, but in manner, gait, and bearing. I called
to the little fellow, and he came and took my hand
with a frankness which charmed me. The schoolmaster
told me that the boy was very clever, and
that, although only six years old, there were but few
of his playmates whom he did not excel. "His father
was an old friend of mine," I said. "Indeed our acquaintance
began when we were not older than this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
child. Would you have any objection to allow the
boy to spend a day with me?"</p>

<p>"I promised his uncle," was the schoolmaster's reply,
"that he should not go out, and that I would
watch him closely; but of course he will be quite safe
with you. Any day that you please to send for him
he shall be ready."</p>

<p>"Does he know anything of his mother?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the schoolmaster. "He was very
young when he came to me. I have no idea who, or
what, or where the mother is, for his uncle did not
enter into the particulars of his parentage. The
mother must have been very fair, if she were a native,
the boy is so very slightly touched with the tar-brush."</p>

<p>I went home, and sent for the mother. She came;
and I entreated her to forego her request, for the
child's sake. I represented to her that it might unsettle
him, and cause him to be discontented. I
assured her that he was now as happy and as well
taken care of as any mother could desire her offspring
to be. On hearing this the poor woman became
frantic. She knelt at my feet and supplicated
me to listen to her entreaty&mdash;a sight of her child, a
few words with him, and a kiss from his lips. She
said she did not wish him to know that she was his
mother; that if I would have him brought into my
house, she would dress in the garb of a servant
woman, or <i>syce's</i> (groom's) wife, and talk to the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
without his being aware that she was the person who
had brought him into the world.</p>

<p>"And you will not play me false?" said I, moved
by her tears. "You will not, when you have once
got hold of the boy, decline to relinquish that hold,
and defy his friends&mdash;as mothers <i>have</i> done&mdash;to take
him from you, except by an order of Court? Remember,
Dooneea (that was her name), that I am
running a great risk; and am, moreover, deceiving
the schoolmaster, and behaving badly to the boy's
uncle, by allowing myself to be swayed by your
tears and my own feelings. Consider what disgrace
you will bring upon me, if you fail to keep your
word in this matter." She bound herself by an oath
that she would do all I required, if I would only give
her the longed-for interview.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at twelve," said I, "you may come
here. At that hour, in this room, the child shall be
with me. Come in the dress of a poor woman, and
bring an infant with you. Let your excuse be that
you have come to complain of the ill-treatment
you have received from your husband, who is in my
service. This will give me an opportunity of bidding
you remain until justice be done, and meanwhile you
will see the boy; and when I go out of the room,
which will be only for a short time, you can talk to
him. Do you know your part, Dooneea?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib."</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at twelve. Salaam, Dooneea!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Salaam, Sahib." She went away with a cheerful
countenance.</p>

<p>There are no such actors in the world as the people
of Hindostan. The boy came to me a little before
twelve, and was reading to me, when Dooneea, with
a child in her arms, and dressed in the shabbiest
apparel, rushed into the room, and commenced an
harangue. She said she had been beaten unmercifully
by her husband, for no cause whatever; that he
had broken one of her fingers, and had attempted to
stab her; but she had saved her life by flight. All
this she accompanied with gesticulations and tears,
according to the custom of complainants in the East.
I feigned to be very angry with the husband, and
hastily left the room, as if to make inquiry and to
send for him.</p>

<p>I ran round to an outer door, and peeped in upon
Dooneea and her boy. She was repeating the same
tale to the child, and the child was imploring her not
to cry. It was a strange scene. The tears she was
now shedding were not mock tears. The boy asked
her how her husband came to beat her? She began
thus:&mdash;"I was sitting near the fire talking to my
eldest boy, and had my arm round his waist&mdash;there,
just as I put my arm round your waist&mdash;and
I said to the boy, 'It is getting very late
and you must go to sleep,' and I pulled him to
my breast&mdash;like this&mdash;and gave him a kiss on his
forehead, then on his eyes&mdash;there&mdash;just as gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as that, yes, just like that. Well, the boy began to
cry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why did he cry? Because you told him to go to
bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Dooneea; "but his father came in,
and thought I was teasing the child. He abused me
and then he beat me."</p>

<p>The woman gazed at her child; and, having a
good excuse for weeping in her alleged wrongs, she
did not scruple to avail herself of it. From behind
the screen which concealed me from her sight, and
that of the boy, I, too, shed tears of pity.</p>

<p>I returned to the room, and said, "Dooneea, since
you are afraid of your life, do not leave this house
until I tell you to do so; but give your infant to the
sweeper's wife to take care of. I do not like your
children in my house."</p>

<p>How thankful she was! She placed her head
upon my feet, and cracked her knuckles over my
knees.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb says that the children of the poor
are adults from infancy. The same may be said of
the children of the rich in India. Dooneea's little
boy discussed the conduct of the cruel husband, and
sympathised with the ill-used wife, as though he had
been called upon to adjudicate the affair in a court of
justice. He even went so far as to say, "What a
wicked man to beat such a dear looking woman!"
and he gave Dooneea the rupee which I had given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
him on the day previous when I saw him at the
school. With what delight did Dooneea tie up that
piece of coin, from the child's hand, in the corner of
her garment. It seemed far more precious to her than
all the jewels which his dead father had presented to
her in days gone by. It was a gift from her own
child, who was living, but to her, dead. Dooneea
spoke Persian&mdash;a language the boy did not understand.
His father had taught Dooneea that language
in order that their servants might not know the tenor
of their discourse. In that language Dooneea now
spoke to me, in the boy's presence.</p>

<p>"Is he not very like his father?" she said.</p>

<p>"Very," I replied.</p>

<p>"Will he be as clever?"</p>

<p>"He is too young for any one to judge of that."</p>

<p>"But he will be as generous" (she pointed to the
coin), "and he will be as tall, as good-looking, as
passionate, as gentle, and as kind."</p>

<p>The boy's boots were muddy. Dooneea observed
this, and with her own little hands cleaned them;
and smiling, she asked him for a present, in that tone
and manner which the poorest menial in Hindostan
adopts when addressing the most haughty superior.</p>

<p>The boy blushed, and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to give her?" said I.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said he; "I gave her my rupee."</p>

<p>"Give her that pretty blue ribbon which is round
your neck, and I will give you one like it," said I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>He took the ribbon from his neck and gave it to
Dooneea.</p>

<p>Dooneea twisted the ribbon in her hair, and began
to weep afresh.</p>

<p>"Do not cry, you silly woman," said I; "I will see
that your husband does not beat you again."</p>

<p>She understood me, and dried her tears.</p>

<p>Dooneea again spoke to me in Persian. "Sahib,"
said she, "they do not wash the children properly at
that school. Order me to do this."</p>

<p>"Charley, why did you come to me in this state,
with your neck unwashed?" I asked the boy.</p>

<p>"We only wash in warm water once a week; on
Saturdays," he replied. "This is Thursday."</p>

<p>"But I cannot allow you to dine with me in this
state," said I, in Hindostanee. "You must be well
washed, my boy. Dooneea, give the child a bath."</p>

<p>With reluctant steps, the child followed his
mother to my bathing-room. I peeped through the
purdah; for I began to fear that I should have some
trouble in parting the mother from her child, and
half repented that I had ever brought them together.
While Dooneea was brushing the child's hair, she
said, "<i>Toomara mama kahan hai?</i>&mdash;Where is your
mother?"</p>

<p>The boy answered, "I do not know."</p>

<p>I began to cough, to inform Dooneea that I was
within hearing, and that I objected to that strain of
examination. She ceased immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>I had an engagement to ride with a lady on the
Mall. My horse was brought to the door; but I was
afraid to leave Dooneea alone with the boy, notwithstanding
her solemn promise that she would not run
off with him. Yet I did not like to hurry that eternal
separation on earth which, for the boy's sake, I was
determined their separation should be.</p>

<p>I walked up and down my verandah for some time,
meditating how I could part them. At last it
occurred to me that I would send the boy away to
his school by stratagem, and trust to chance how I
might best explain to Dooneea that he would not
return. I ordered a <i>syce</i> (groom) to saddle a little
pony that I possessed, and told Dooneea that I wished
the boy to take a ride with me, and that while we
were absent, she ought to take some food. It stung
me to the soul to witness how innocent she was of my
intentions; for she seemed pleased that I should show
her child so much attention as to be seen in public
with him.</p>

<p>As soon as we were out of sight of my house, I took
the road for Landour, delivered the boy over to his
schoolmaster, told my groom to keep the pony out
till after dark, cantered to the Mall, kept my engagement,
and returned to my home at about half-past
seven o'clock. There was Dooneea waiting for us in
the verandah.</p>

<p>"Where is the boy?" she inquired, on finding me
return alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave her no reply; but dismounted and approached
her. Taking hold of her wrists, I said, in
the gentlest voice, "Dooneea, I have fulfilled my
promise. You have seen your child, you have spoken
to him, you have kissed him. Enough. He has now
gone back to school. You must not see him again, if
you really love him."</p>

<p>She trembled in my grasp, looked piteously in my
face, gasped several times for breath, as though she
longed to speak, and swooned at my feet. I lifted
her, carried her into the house, and laid her upon my
bed; then sent for servants, and for a doctor, who
lived near my bungalow. The doctor came. While
he felt her pulse, and placed his hand over her heart,
I briefly explained to him what had taken place. He
still kept his finger on the vein, and gazed on Dooneea's
beautiful face. Blood began to trickle from
her nostrils, and from her ears, staining the bed linen
and the squalid garments in which she had attired
herself. In a few minutes the doctor released his
hold of her wrist. "Poor thing!" he ejaculated.
"Her troubles are over! She is at rest!"</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>She was dead.</p>

<h2>BLACK AND BLUE.</h2>


<p>Forty years ago there went out to India, in the good
ship <i>Globe</i>, Ensign the Honourable Francis Gay, a
younger son of the Right Honourable the Earl of
Millflower. The ensign was in his nineteenth year,
and was proceeding to join his regiment, which was
stationed at Chinsurah.</p>

<p>Lord Millflower, in his heart, hoped that his son
would never return: he was so great a disgrace to
his family. There was no vice with which this
youth was unfamiliar. He had been expelled from
no fewer than seven schools. In two instances his
offence was theft. His conduct had so preyed upon
the mind of Lady Millflower that she lost her reason.
At seventeen, he committed several forgeries of his
eldest brother's, Lord Larkspeare's name; and he
took a similar liberty with the name of his father's
steward. But these offences were hushed up. He
was also guilty of a deed of violence, for which his
life would have been forfeited had the case been
tried, instead of compromised; for in those days such
a deed of violence was a capital offence. His family
were in constant fear lest he should be transported as
a felon, or hanged at Newgate. It was, therefore,
some satisfaction to them when the Honourable
Francis consented to hold a commission and join his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
regiment in India. Lord Millflower's other sons,
four in number, were all steady, well-conducted, and
rather dull beings, while Francis was remarkably
gifted, as well as remarkably vicious. He had both
talent and genius, humour and wit; and, much as he
had neglected his education, he was well read and
well informed for his time of life. In personal appearance,
also, the reprobate had the advantage over
his brethren. None of them were even good-looking
except Francis, who was really very handsome, well
proportioned, and tall. His manners also, always frank,
were, when he pleased, dignified and courteous, and
his bearing peculiarly graceful. What he wanted
was feeling, to regulate his passions. Of feeling, he
was in his youth, wholly destitute.</p>

<p>Lord Millflower had taken the precaution of writing
to the colonel of the regiment his son was about to
join, and of at the same time enclosing a sum of
money for the purpose of freeing Francis from any
pecuniary difficulty. Colonel Role himself had the
misfortune to have a very bad boy, and he, therefore,
sympathized deeply with the worthy nobleman, and
resolved to do all in his power to reform the Honourable
Francis.</p>

<p>After a passage of four months, the <i>Globe</i> arrived
at Calcutta, and the Honourable Francis Gay proceeded
to Chinsurah and joined. For several weeks
he conducted himself with (for him) wonderful propriety.
It is true, that he drank and played at billiards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and cards, and sometimes an oath would escape
his lips, but he indulged in no excesses. The officers
of the regiment, indeed, thought the ensign a great
acquisition, for he was not only a very pleasant but
an entertaining companion.</p>

<p>But, by degrees, the Honourable Francis fell off;
and ere long, so far from having a friend in the regiment,
there was no one who would speak to him.
Even the colonel was compelled to forbid him his
house. Many, very many acts, unbecoming the
character of an officer and a gentleman, had been
looked over by his seniors; but it was resolved that,
on the very next occasion of his transgressing, the
Honourable Ensign should be brought to a court-martial
and dismissed the service. This resolve was
communicated to the ensign by the colonel, who had
become tired of lecturing him.</p>

<p>"The next time you are intoxicated on the parade
ground, or the next time you use bad language in the
mess-room, or the next time you publicly insult a
brother officer, provoking him to quarrel with you,
you will forfeit your commission." Being the son of
an earl, he was entitled&mdash;many colonels think&mdash;to
every possible chance of redemption. Had he been
the son of a commoner, he would, most probably,
have been court-martialled and cashiered for the
very first offence.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied the ensign, with a low
bow; "I will be more cautious in future."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>He kept his word. From this time he did his duty
extremely well; and, to all outward appearance, was
a reformed character. The officers observing this,
generously made advances with a view to resuming
their former relations with him. But the Honourable
Francis repulsed their advances. The whole regiment
had thought proper to cut him; and he now
thought proper to cut the whole regiment.</p>

<p>Several months passed, and during that period the
ensign applied himself to Hindostanee and Persian.
He encouraged the natives to come to his bungalow,
to talk with him, and by night and by day pursued
his studies. The result was, that he soon conversed
with perfect ease and accuracy. He now began to
live like a native&mdash;a Mahommedan; and, except when
he had to attend to his regimental duties, he wore
the native costume, and abstained from drink entirely.
With truth, he might have said with Conrad,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
The grape's gay juice my bosom never cheers;<br />
I'm more than Moslem when the cup appears.<br />
</div>

<p>His food was rice, milk, vegetables, and fruit; the
bed upon which he slept was hard and mean; such
as the natives use. The whole of his European furniture
he sold by auction.</p>

<p>His desire&mdash;the desire of a doubtfully reformed
reprobate&mdash;to convert to Christianity a young Mahommedan
girl, astonished all those who became acquainted
with this desire. The girl was the daughter
of a water-carrier (Bheestie). She was not like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
natives of India, but more like those of Africa. She
was coal black, and had thick lips and wavy hair.
She was short for her age&mdash;fourteen years&mdash;but
thickset, with powerful limbs. The girl's father told
the servants belonging to other officers of the regiment,
and the curious whim of Gay's became a topic of conversation.</p>

<p>Jehan, the bheestie's daughter, was a virtuous girl,
and Francis Gay had never approached her with a
view to undermining her virtue. It was no easy
matter to persuade her to change her religion; but,
strange to say, he at length succeeded, and Noor
Jehan was baptized as Ellen by a missionary who
journeyed to Chinsurah for the purpose of performing
the ceremony. The sanity or otherwise of the ensign
was now very generally discussed in the regiment,
and the prevalent opinion was that he was a lunatic.
But the good colonel was a little angry at the surmise.
"Surely," he said, "you do not accuse a man
of being a maniac because he has converted an infidel."</p>

<p>The regiment was ordered to march to Cawnpore,
whither Ellen and her father also proceeded. Cawnpore
was then the chief station in the upper provinces
of India. Five thousand troops were quartered there.
A regiment of dragoons, a regiment of native cavalry,
a regiment of British infantry, and two of native infantry.
Besides horse and foot there were companies
of artillery, and sappers and miners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Very shortly after the regiment was settled in
Cawnpore, the Honourable Francis Gay paid a visit
to the chaplain, and intimated a desire to be married.
The chaplain of course replied that he should be
most happy, and there and then a day and hour was
appointed for the performance of the rite; but, when
the reverend gentleman came to hear who was to be
the Honourable Ensign's bride&mdash;the black daughter
of a native water-carrier&mdash;he could not help remarking:</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Gay, that I cannot with sincerity
offer you my congratulations."</p>

<p>To which the ensign responded:</p>

<p>"My good sir, I did not ask them." And retired
with a bow.</p>

<p>The chaplain drove to the house of Colonel Role,
and told him of the interview which had just taken
place between himself and Ensign the Honourable
Francis Gay. The colonel called upon the young
man, and entreated him to reflect. "I <i>have</i> reflected,
sir," was the ensign's reply. The colonel then went
to the general, and the general sent for Mr. Gay to
attend at his bungalow. Mr. Gay obeyed the summons,
and listened with attention and much calmness
to a long and violent speech. When it was ended,
however, Mr. Gay, with extreme courtesy, and in the
quietest of tones, spoke thus:</p>

<p>"General, you had a right to command my attendance
here upon any military matter, but not upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
any civil matter. However, I waive that, because I
believe your intention to be a good one. You,
general, have arrived at the years of discretion&mdash;perhaps
at something beyond those years. You have, at
all events, arrived at a time of life when the tumultuous
passion of youth can no longer be pleaded in
extenuation of certain follies. Now tell me, general,
which of us, think you, sins the most, and sets the
worst example to the men, European and native, in
this station?&mdash;I, who wish to marry this good Christian
girl; or you, who have in your house&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Gay
then made mention of two very discreditable members
of the general's establishment. "This is a question
which I shall put to the commander-in-chief, if you
abide by your threat to report me to his excellency."</p>

<p>That night the general and Colonel Role held a
consultation. The colonel still doubted the ensign's
insanity. It had become a fixed idea in the regiment
that Gay was insane. The general caught at this,
and a committee of doctors was appointed to examine
the ensign. They reported that Ensign the Honourable
Francis Gay was not only of sound mind, but
one of the most intellectual young men in the station;
and that he had explained to their entire satisfaction
certain conversations which he had frequently held
with himself in Chinsurah, at the mess-table.</p>

<p>The wedding-day had been put off in consequence
of these proceedings; but the parties now met
in the church, which was crowded with officers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
including nearly the entire medical staff, who were
curious to witness the spectacle. There stood the
tall and handsome English aristocrat, and beside
him his coal-black bride, dressed in garments of red
silk, trimmed with yellow and gold tinsel. The ensign
acted as the interpreter, and explained to Ellen
in Hindoostanee the vows she was required to take.
This made the ceremony a very long one. When it
was concluded, the bride got into her palanquin and
was carried home. The bridegroom mounted his
pony, and rode by her side.</p>

<p>Ellen&mdash;now the Honourable Mrs. Gay&mdash;was a girl
of great natural ability, of an excellent disposition,
and was blessed with an excellent temper. She had,
moreover, a very sweet voice. After her marriage
she was never seen by any European in Cawnpore,
except her husband. It was believed that the ensign
saved more than two-thirds of his pay, which Ellen,
who had an excellent idea of business, used to lend
out in small sums to people in the bazaar at the rate
of fifty per cent. per mensem. If she lent a rupee
(two shillings), she would get back at the end of the
month a rupee and eight annas (three shillings) by
way of interest.</p>

<p>A year passed away, and a son and heir was born
to the Honourable Francis Gay. The child had light
blue eyes, exactly like those of his father; but his
complexion was quite as black as his mother's. When
the child was three months old, it was brought to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
church, and publicly christened, Mr. Gay and the
pay-sergeant of the company he belonged to being
the godfathers, and Ellen the godmother. The names
given to the infant were Ernest Augustus George
Francis Frederick&mdash;such being the names respectively
of Lord Millflower's sons. Ernest was the eldest,
Augustus the second, George the third, Francis the
fourth, and Frederick the fifth and youngest. Not
long after the birth of his son, Ensign Gay obtained
his promotion to the rank of lieutenant, and received,
of course, an increase of pay.</p>

<p>Fever became prevalent, and cholera. Several of
the captains and senior lieutenants fell victims; and,
in less than three years, Lieutenant Gay got his company
(the regiment was now at Meerut), and retired
from the army by the sale of his captain's commission.
It was supposed that he was worth a great deal of
money&mdash;a lac of rupees (ten thousand pounds) at the
very least. Whither he went no one knew, and no
one cared. One of the servants, whom he discharged
previous to leaving the station of Meerut, said he believed
that his master had gone either to Affghanistan
or to Lahore.</p>

<p>Let us now return to Europe. A few years after
Captain Gay had sold out of the army, his eldest
brother, Lord Larkspeare, was killed while grouse-shooting,
by the accidental discharge of his gun; his
second brother, Augustus, a captain in the army, was
lost in a vessel which was bringing him home from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Canada; his third brother, George, died of small-pox
three days after he had taken his father's second title.
Of his son Francis's marriage, Lord Millflower had
been informed, and also of the birth of the black
child, the Honourable Ernest Augustus George Francis
Frederick Gay. Colonel Role had deemed it his
duty not to withhold these facts, albeit they were
disagreeable to communicate to the noble earl. Lord
Millflower begged of Colonel Role to institute an
inquiry into the fate of his Francis, and the Colonel
did so, but without success. No clue to his whereabout
could be discovered, nor could any one say what
had become of him. Under these circumstances it
was taken for granted that he was dead. Another
five years passed away, and the Earl of Millflower
departed this life. He was, of course, succeeded in
his titles and estates by his son Frederick.</p>

<p>Now let us return to Francis. He became a dealer
in precious stones, and travelled over the whole of
India, under the name of Mustapha Khan, visiting
the various native courts. Every tour that he made
occupied him three years. Constantly moving about
in the sun had tanned his once fair face; and neither
from his appearance&mdash;for he was dressed as a native&mdash;nor
from his speech, could the natives themselves
detect that he was an European. He gave out that
his birthplace was Nepaul, where the natives are
sometimes born with blue eyes. He bought and
sold, and was apparently very happy in his occupation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
His wife and son invariably accompanied him in his
travels. He had never written to his family since his
arrival in India, and had not received letters from
any member thereof. India he loved, England he
detested, and would not have taken up his father's
title if it had been a dukedom. He never approached
the abode of an European, and never saw a newspaper.
He was not likely, therefore, to hear of the
changes that had taken place at home. In the
bazaar at Delhi Captain Gay had a small house, in
which were deposited his effects, a few boxes filled
with clothes, books, &amp;c., his sword, and the uniform
he used formerly to wear. These were under the
care of a man-servant, a sweeper. The bulk of his
worldly wealth he invariably carried about his person,
as many natives of India do.</p>

<p>Ernest Gay was now twelve years of age. He was
usually called by his parents Chandee, a word signifying
silver. Chandee was clever and cunning, and
had a wonderful talent for calculating numbers. In
less than a minute, by counting on his fingers, he
would tell you the interest due on such sums as three
rupees, five annas, and seven pic, for twenty-one days,
at forty-one three-fourth per cent. English he had
never heard spoken; and as he had never been taught
that language, he did not understand a single word
of it. Nor could he read or write Hindoostanee,
although he spoke it in all its purity and elegance.</p>

<p>There was about to take place a marriage in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
family of the Rajah of Pulbecala. Mustapha Khan
(Francis Gay) journeyed from Delhi to the Rajah's
court, to exhibit his jewels. He had diamonds, rubies,
and emeralds of great price, and some of these he
hoped to dispose of to advantage. The Rajah, however,
had already provided himself with these matters,
and therefore confined his purchases to a large cat's-eye
ring, for which he paid Mustapha fifty gold
mohurs (eighty pounds). On his way back to Delhi,
at a place called Kunda Ka Serai, a band of robbers
attacked the jewel-merchant. They hacked him to
pieces with their swords, but they spared his wife and
the boy. The whole of their treasures were stolen;
even the rings from Ellen's ears and fingers, and the
gold bangles which Chandee wore upon his arms.</p>

<p>When her senses were restored to her, Ellen, with
the assistance of her son, dug a grave in the sand,
and buried her butchered husband. The bearers who
carried the palanquins ran away as soon as the robbers
attacked the party, and were no more seen. Most
probably they had some small share of the booty, the
value of which the Sirdar estimated at four lacs of
rupees (forty thousand pounds). Whatever had been
Francis Gay's vices when a youth&mdash;and they were
great enough in all conscience&mdash;he had been a kind
and affectionate husband to Ellen, and she most bitterly
deplored his loss; violent was the grief of
Chandee, who was devotedly fond of his father.</p>

<p>They heaped stones over the grave of the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
man, to mark the spot where he was laid, and, after
their own fashion, offered up prayers for the repose
of his soul.</p>

<p>The murder having been committed within the
dominions of an independent prince, Ellen knew that
her wrongs were not likely to be redressed if she
complained; and that the British Government would
not interfere, unless she made known that her husband
was an Englishman. This she felt would be
contrary to the wishes of the dead. Hopeless and
helpless, she and her son made the best of their way
to Delhi, where, having collected a few debts that
were due to them, they established a small shop for
the sale of native sweetmeats. They carried on this
business for three or four years, when Chandee grew
weary of it, and set up in the world as a box-waller,
or pedler. His box contained pens, ink, and paper,
needles, pins, knives, scissors, soap, eau de Cologne,
tooth-brushes, matches, and so forth. His customers
were the European officers, who gave him the name
of Black and Blue, from the colour of his eyes and
skin. A box-waller is always a great cheat&mdash;as great
a rascal as was Autolycus himself; Black and Blue,
if the truth must be told, was not an exception to the
rule or race. But no one could grudge him his
profits when the cuffs and kicks which were playfully
administered to him by the young lieutenants and
ensigns are taken into consideration. Black and
Blue always took the rough usage of his customers in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
excellent part; and would generally make some
such appeal as this (he had picked up a little English
by this time): "Ah, well! I know! You rich white
gentlemans&mdash;I poor black devil. I pray all day all
night that ensign be made leeft'nunt; leeft'nunt, capitaine;
capitaine, capitain-meejor; meejor, kunnull;
kunnull, meejor-jinneral; and then God bless your
father and mother, and brother and sister; and then,
for all that pray, I get so much kick and so many
bad words. God make us all&mdash;black and white; all
equal right up above. You want blacking? Here you
are. Very good blacking&mdash;quite genuine; only one
rupee a bottle. I suppose you not got ready money!
Very well, I wait till pay-day come. I very poor
man. You my master. Khuda Lord Kuren." The
meaning of this expression, with which most natives
wind up a speech to an European, signifies, May God
make you a lord!</p>

<p>When Black and Blue was no more than five years
old, he was playing one morning in his father's compound
(enclosure&mdash;the land around the bungalow),
when a pariah dog rushed in and mangled him very
severely. The dog was rabid. Captain Gay called
in the doctor of a native cavalry regiment, who lived
in the next bungalow, who cauterized the wounds.
The child was bitten on the arms, legs, and chest,
and was under the doctor's treatment for upwards of
five weeks. On several occasions when he visited his
patient, the doctor saw and conversed with Ellen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
who was naturally very anxious touching the child's
safety. This doctor was one of the number who
witnessed the marriage of Ensign Gay at Cawnpore,
and was also present when his offspring was christened.</p>

<p>Shortly after the recovery of the little boy, the
doctor had been appointed a presidency surgeon, and
had charge of one of the hospitals in Calcutta, where
he remained for upwards of twenty years. He was
then appointed superintending surgeon of the Meerut
division. He had a son at Delhi, a lieutenant in the
foot artillery, and occasionally went over (the distance
is only forty miles from Meerut) to pay him a visit.</p>

<p>On one of these occasions, Black and Blue, who had
been sent for, made his appearance with his box, sat
down on the carpet cross-legged, and opened out his
treasures. There were several young officers in the
bungalow, chums of the lieutenant; and, while the
bargaining was going on, they began to tease Black
and Blue. One removed his turban with the point
of a stick; another sprinkled him with his eau de
Cologne; a third touched the tip of his great toe (he
had left his shoes, out of respect, in the verandah)
with the lighted end of a cheroot. Black and Blue
howled with pain, whereupon the two roared with
laughter. The doctor, who was reading a paper,
begged the young men to desist, and, somewhat
angrily, expostulated with his son for treating a native
so cruelly; for he was touched with poor Black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Blue's appeal&mdash;"God make us all. When fire burns
black man, black man feels as much pain as white
man. In hell, you rich gentlemans sing out just as
much as poor box-waller."</p>

<p>"Black and Blue is used to it, governor," said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Stuff, Robert!" said the doctor; "I address myself
to you, and not to these gentlemen, when I say that
I have no patience with such flippant cruelty."</p>

<p>"Sahib," said Black and Blue, looking up at the
doctor, "you are very good gentlemans&mdash;very kind
man, and very handsome. May God make you a
lord; may your throne be perpetual, and may your
end be peace; but do not be angry with these gentlemen.
They play tricks with Black and Blue; but
they are no enemies. If enemies, what for send to
buy Black and Blue's property? Sir, you greatly
oblige Black and Blue if you smile once more on
these gentlemans. Sir, do you want any violent (violet)
powder, or one small patent corkiscrew (corkscrew)?
All men born equal; God's rain wet black man and
white man all the same. Devil's fire burn, too, both
the same." Here he laughed at the lieutenant.
"Take one packet of violent-powder. Every one
rupee a packet. Well, then, take two for one, twelve.
That can't hurt anybody. Less than prime cost, I
give you my solemn word. Handsome sir, don't be
angry."</p>

<p>The doctor, his attention attracted by those light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
blue eyes, set in that very black skin, stared at Black
and Blue for several minutes after he had finished
the speech above quoted. He had never before seen
such a peculiar expression as that on the face of the
box-waller. Suddenly he recollected an instance of
black skin and light blue eyes; but in that case the
boy was half-European, the child of the Honourable
Francis Gay.</p>

<p>Black and Blue had occasion to change his position;
and, in doing so, exposed the calves of his legs. On
one of them was a scar, quite round, and about the
size of a shilling.</p>

<p>"Good God!" exclaimed the doctor, who became
both surprised and agitated, and allowed the newspaper
to fall from his hand.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, governor?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing!" said the doctor, still
staring at Black and Blue, whose countenance was
no longer strange to him. "How did you come
by that mark?" he at length asked, pointing to the
scar.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Sahib."</p>

<p>"But did not your parents ever tell you?"</p>

<p>"No, Sahib. Parents used to say that it come of
itself."</p>

<p>This was no doubt true.</p>

<p>"Have you another mark like that on your right
arm&mdash;just here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor placed his finger on the sleeve of the
man's dress.</p>

<p>"Yes. But bigger mark that one. How you know
that, Sahib?" He pulled up his sleeve and exhibited
a scar the size of half-a-crown.</p>

<p>"And another here&mdash;on your hip&mdash;and another
here, on your ribs?"</p>

<p>"Yes. All them marks got, sir. How you know
that, Sahib?"</p>

<p>The doctor was quite satisfied that Black and Blue
was no other than his little patient of former years,
and consequently the heir to the Earldom of Millflower.
Could it be possible, he thought, that Captain Gay
eventually abandoned his black wife and child! If
not, how came it that the boy (now a man of two or
three and twenty) should be a miserable pedler, living
in the Bazaar at Delhi? When Black and Blue had
sold all that the young officers wanted to buy&mdash;when
no amount of coaxing and flattering would induce
them to take anything more&mdash;he was about to take
his departure; but the doctor desired him to stay,
and intimated to his son that he wished to have some
conversation in private with Black and Blue.</p>

<p>"Where is your father?" the doctor asked.</p>

<p>"He dead, Sahib."</p>

<p>"When did he die?"</p>

<p>"Long time ago&mdash;ten or twelve year ago."</p>

<p>"Where did he die?"</p>

<p>"Mans&mdash;robber mans&mdash;kill him with sword."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"And your mother?"</p>

<p>Black and Blue told the doctor the whole of their
history since the death of Captain Gay, and his statements
were substantially true. Black and Blue,
however, declared most positively that his father was
a native, and no European.</p>

<p>"Do you think," the doctor inquired, "that your
mother would see me, if I went down to her home?"</p>

<p>"O yes&mdash;why not? Come along, Sahib. I will
show where she live. You call for palanquin and
get on. I run alongside."</p>

<p>The doctor's curiosity was very strong, and he could
not resist the desire to satisfy it at once. He accepted
Black and Blue's invitation, and went to the house
occupied by Ellen. Habited as a native, she was
sitting on a coarse mat, smoking, and at the same
time mending an old garment of her son's.</p>

<p>The doctor recognised Ellen immediately, albeit
she was now aged. But at first she did not recognise
him. He was altered very much in appearance. His
hair and whiskers had become very grey, and he no
longer wore a moustache.</p>

<p>Ellen parried all the questions that were put to
her, and affected to be as much surprised by them
as by the doctor's visit. The statement of her son
she supported, that her husband was a native of
India.</p>

<p>"O, but surely," said the doctor, "this was the boy
whom I attended at Meerut, many years ago, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you and your Sahib were living near the Begum's
bridge?"</p>

<p>The poor woman looked at him for a moment, then
repeated his name, and burst into tears. Her recollections
crowded before her too thickly to admit of her
dissembling any further with her visitor; and she admitted
that she was the widow of Captain Gay, of her
Majesty's &mdash;&mdash; Regiment of Foot.</p>

<p>The doctor was under no promise to Ellen to keep
his discovery secret; and feeling at liberty to speak
of it, did so publicly as well as in private. The
peerages were looked into, and Black and Blue's
pedigree examined. There were the names of all
the late lord's sons, and sure enough there was
Francis's name above that of Frederick's, the present
earl; opposite to the name of Francis were the letters
signifying, "died unmarried." Black and Blue
of course became an object of great curiosity. His
right to a title did not induce him to alter his prices
in any way, and hence he was kicked and cuffed, and
abused as much as ever, by the young lieutenants and
ensigns, who, by-the-bye, always addressed him as
"my lord," and "your lordship."</p>

<p>"Pomatum, my lord! Pomatum, did you say?
Yes! But let me smell it. O! your lordship calls
this pomatum! I call it hog's lard washed in sandalwood
water. How much? One rupee! O, you villanous
peer of the realm! are you not ashamed of
yourself?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Another would thus address him:</p>

<p>"Look here, Lord Black and Blue. Why don't you
go home and upset your uncle? Turn him out of his
title and estates&mdash;eh? You would be sure to marry
some beautiful girl."</p>

<p>To this Black and Blue would respond:</p>

<p>"What do I want with title and beautiful gal!
This is my home, and I got good business, good many
friends, and two or three very beautiful gal."</p>

<p>"Where, Black and Blue?"</p>

<p>"Ah! that is my business."</p>

<p>"Well, what will you sell your title for?"</p>

<p>"Well, what you offer?"</p>

<p>"One hundred rupees" (10<i>l.</i>)</p>

<p>"Say one hundred and twenty-five."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, take it&mdash;there. Give money, and I give
receipt. You write it out; I sign it. Sold one title
to Ensign Matheson for a hundred rupees."</p>

<p>"But there are two titles, you ass; one an earldom,
and the other a viscounty."</p>

<p>"Well, you take the two; give two hundred rupees
for both."</p>

<p>"No. The one I have already bought is the
biggest and of the best quality; the other is the
small one, and of inferior quality."</p>

<p>"Well, I make reduction in price; take one with
the other, and give me one hundred and seventy-five
rupees. That can't hurt anybody that wants a title."</p>

<p>Would any of these lads, who had nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
world beyond their pay, have consented to an union
between Black and Blue and one of their sisters, after he
had come into what were his rights? No! Would the
poorest and most unprincipled officers&mdash;civil and military&mdash;in
the whole of India? No! Would any
European girl of respectability who had lived in India,
to say nothing of the daughters of gentlemen and
ladies, have wedded the black heir to the title and
estates of the Earl of Millflower? No. Not in India
could his sable lordship have found a virtuous white
woman to accept his hand!</p>

<p>In due course the story of Black and Blue's birth
crept into the columns of one of the Calcutta newspapers,
and ere long an attorney of the Supreme
Court paid a visit to the imperial city, and had an
interview with Black and Blue. He proposed to the
box-waller to take him to England, and establish his
claim to the estates, which he truthfully represented
as worth more than half a million sterling&mdash;fifty lacs
of rupees. He, the attorney, would pay all expenses
of the suit, and in the event of success, which was certain,
would receive only five per cent. or fifty thousand
pounds, leaving Black and Blue a balance of forty-five
lacs.</p>

<p>Black and Blue, who loved and adored money, on
hearing such a sum spoken of, rolled his blue eyes
and red tongue, and almost fainted. But then, to
cross the black water!&mdash;as the natives call the ocean&mdash;that
thought made him shudder and shake his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The attorney represented to him that he should
live in great comfort during the voyage; that the best
cabin in the ship should be taken for him; that he
should have servants about him; and drawing forth
a number of prints of English beauties, he exhibited
them to the gaze of Black and Blue.</p>

<p>Black and Blue said he would consult his European
friends. He did so, and many of those friends dissuaded
him from going to England. Not that they
had any doubt as to the issue of his claim, if it should
be disputed; but upon the reasonable ground that he
was very happy where he was. Others advised him
to go by all means, and take up his title and the
wealth that pertained to it. His mother entreated
him not to leave her. But in the end the voice of
the attorney prevailed, and Black and Blue declared
himself ready to accompany him.</p>

<p>Ten thousand rupees (one thousand pounds) were
given to Ellen for her support during the temporary
absence of her son, who was to return as soon as he
had realized his forty-five lacs (four hundred and fifty
thousand pounds). It was said that a mercantile firm
in Calcutta, in which an illustrious native gentleman
was a partner, advanced the means required for the
purpose of establishing the black man's right to the
earldom.</p>

<p>The attorney possessed himself of the proofs. He
had the papers of the Honourable Francis Gay,
amongst which were letters from the late Lord Millflower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to his eldest brother, Lord Larkspeare. He
also, in the presence of credible witnesses, received
from the hands of Ellen the dead man's uniform;
secondly, he had the deposition on oath of the superintending
surgeon, and of several other officers who
were cognizant of every particular. Many gave these
depositions with reluctance, but felt bound to speak
the truth when interrogated. In a word, the attorney
got his case up remarkably well.</p>

<p>Black and Blue and the attorney left Calcutta in
one of the large passenger ships, and in the month of
April landed at Gravesend, whence they journeyed to
London. Here Black and Blue was prevailed upon
to wear Christian clothes. In his snow-white muslin
dress, his pink turban, and his red slippers covered
with gold embroidery, Black and Blue had looked an
aristocratic native, notwithstanding he was so very
black. [Colour is no criterion of high caste or rank
in India. The late Maharajah Rooder Singh, of
Darbungah, whose family&mdash;to borrow a phrase from
"Burke's Peerage"&mdash;is one of stupendous antiquity,
had the complexion of an African; while his younger
brother, Basdeo, who now sits on the throne, is far
fairer than his Highness the Maharajah Dulleep
Singh.] But in his black trousers, black waistcoat,
black surtout coat, white neckcloth, black beaver hat,
and Wellington boots, poor Black and Blue looked
truly hideous; while his slouching Indian gait would
have led most people to conclude that he was intoxicated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Poor Black and Blue had never tasted
anything stronger than water in the whole course of
his life.</p>

<p>The attorney had an interview with Frederick
Earl of Millflower. He wrote to the firm in Calcutta
to that effect, and he further stated that the
Earl had set him at defiance, and that he was about
to institute a suit in the proper court.</p>

<p>This was the last that was ever heard in India of
Black and Blue, or of the attorney. Inquiries were
instituted, but with no avail. There were many conjectures;
the one most generally entertained was, that
poor Black and Blue and his undoubted claim were
disposed of by the attorney for a sum which satisfied
him, and that Black and Blue was secretly led into
indulgences in some foreign country and died of their
effects. But his mother, who is still living, will not
believe that he is dead, and feels convinced that some
day or other he will turn up and be restored to her.</p>

<p>"What on earth became of that black earl?" is a
question very often put by many who were acquainted
with his strange history.</p>

<h2>THE RANEE OF JHANSI.</h2>


<p>About a month after the order had gone forth for
the annexation of the little province of Jhansi (in
1854), and previous to a wing of the 13th Native Infantry
occupying the country, I received a letter in
Persian, written upon "gold paper," from the Ranee,
begging me to pay her a visit. The letter was
brought to me by two natives of rank. One had
been the financial minister of the late Rajah. The
other was the head vakeel (attorney) of the Ranee.</p>

<p>The revenues of Jhansi were some six lacs (60,000<i>l.</i>)
a year, and after disbursing the expenses of government,
and paying the troops in the late Rajah's service,
the balance was some two lacs and a half (25,000<i>l.</i>)
profit. The "troops" were not numerous, under 1000
in all, and they were chiefly horsemen. The arrangement,
when the country was annexed, was simply this:
that the Ranee should receive a pension of 6000<i>l.</i> a
year, to be paid monthly.</p>

<p>The Ranee's object in asking me to visit her at
Jhansi was to consult me as to the possibility of getting
the order for annexation annulled, or reversed. I
should mention that the Ranee had applied to me at
the instance of a gentleman of the Civil Service, who
had once been the Resident, or Governor-General's
agent, at a native court in the upper provinces; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
gentleman who, in common with many other officials
of rank in India, regarded the annexation of Jhansi&mdash;"a
trumpery state after all"&mdash;not only as impolitic,
but unjust and without excuse. The facts were
briefly these:&mdash;The late Rajah had no issue by his
only wife (the woman who caused our countrymen and
countrywomen and children to be put to death in the
fort, and who, according to late advices, has been
killed), and some weeks previous to his death, being
"sound of mind, though infirm in body," he publicly
adopted an heir, and gave notice to the Government
of having done so through the proper channel&mdash;namely,
the Governor-General's representative then stationed
at Jhansi. In short, all the forms required by the
Government to prevent fraud in such cases, had been
complied with. The child was taken into the Rajah's
lap, in the presence of his assembled people, and in
the presence of the Governor-General's representative,
and he, moreover, signed a document, duly attested,
reciting his act and deed. The Rajah was a Brahmin;
the adopted boy was a near relative of his.</p>

<p>The Jhansi Rajah had been particularly faithful to
the British Government, and Lord William Bentinck
had presented the brother of the late Rajah with a
British ensign, and a letter giving him the title of
"Rajah," and assuring him that that title, and the
independence attached to it, would be guaranteed by
the British Government to him, the Rajah, and his
heirs and <i>successors</i> (by adoption). That that treaty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
(for such it purported to be) of Lord William Bentinck
was violated, without the slightest shadow of a pretence,
there cannot be any sort of doubt. In the time of the
Peishwah, the late Rajah of Jhansi was simply a large
zemindar (landholder), and had he remained untitled
there can be no question that his last wishes, so far as
the disposition of his property was concerned, would
have been attended to. It was the acceptance of the
"Rajahship" which led to the confiscation of his
estates, and the exchange of 6000<i>l.</i> a year for 25,000<i>l.</i>
a year. Strange as that assertion may seem to the
reader, it is nevertheless true.</p>

<p>I was at Agra when I received the Ranee's letter,
and Agra is two days' journey. Even as I travelled
from Jhansi, I sympathized with the woman. The
boy whom the Rajah had adopted was only six years
old, and during his minority, that is to say, until he
had attained his eighteenth year, the Ranee&mdash;so the
Rajah willed&mdash;was to have been the Regent, and
the boy's guardian; and it is no small matter for a
woman&mdash;a native woman of rank, too&mdash;to give up
such a position and become a pensioner, even on 6000<i>l.</i>
a year. Let me detail the particulars of my journey
to the residence of the Ranee of Jhansi. I got into
my palanquin at dusk, and on the following morning,
at daylight, arrived at Gwalior. The Rajah of Jhansi
had a small house about a mile and a half from the
cantonment, which was used as a halting-place, and
thither I was taken by the minister and the vakeel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who accompanied me. At ten o'clock, after I had
breakfasted and smoked my hookah, it was proposed
that we "go on at once." The day was very warm,
but the Ranee had sent a large and comfortable
palanquin carriage; in short, it was more like a small
room than a carriage, fitted up as it was with every
convenience, including even a punkah, which was
pulled from the outside by a servant, who sat upon a
foot-board. In the carriage, beside myself and the
minister and vakeel, was a khansamah, or butler, who,
with the apparatus between his knees, kept on cooling
water, and wine, and beer, in order that, whenever I
felt thirsty, I might be supplied at a moment's notice.
This enormous carriage was drawn by a pair of horses
of immense strength and swiftness. Each stood about
seventeen hands high. The late Rajah had imported
them from France at a cost of 1500<i>l.</i> The road was
rather rough in many places, but, on the average, we
got over it at the rate of about nine miles an hour.
At about two o'clock in the day we entered the Jhansi
territory, having changed horses twice, and we had
now some nine miles to drive. Hitherto we had been
escorted only by four sowars (horsemen), but now our
escort amounted to about fifty, each horseman carrying
an immense spear, and dressed much in the same
way as the Irregular Cavalry in the pay of the East
India Company. And along the road, at intervals of
a few hundred yards, were horsemen drawn up, and
as we passed, they joined the cavalcade; so that by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time we came in sight of the fortress&mdash;if those old
weak walls, surmounted by some nine pieces of old
ordnance of inferior calibre, deserved the name&mdash;the
whole strength of the Jhansi cavalry was in attendance.
The carriage was driven to a place called "the Rajah's
garden," where I alighted, and was conducted by the
financial minister and the vakeel and other servants
of state, to a large tent, which was pitched beneath a
clump of gigantic mango trees. The tent, which was
that in which the late Rajah used to receive the civil
and military officers of the British Government, was
elegantly fitted up, and carpeted; and at least a
dozen domestic servants were ready to do my bidding.
I must not omit to mention that the companions of
my journey&mdash;the minister and the vakeel&mdash;were both
men of good ability and pleasing manners. They were,
moreover, men of learning, so that my time upon the
road had been beguiled very agreeably.</p>

<p>The Ranee had consulted one of the many Brahmins
who were supported by her as to the most
propitious hour for me to come to the purdah behind
which she sat; and the Brahmins had told her that
it must be between the setting of the sun and the
rising of the moon, which was then near her full; in
other words, between half-past five and half-past six
o'clock.</p>

<p>This important matter having been communicated
to me, I expressed myself perfectly satisfied with the
time of the appointment, and ordered dinner accordingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
This done, the financial minister, after betraying
some embarrassment, intimated that he wished
to speak to me on a rather delicate subject, and that,
with my permission, he would order all the menial
servants in attendance on me, including my own
sirdar-bearer (valet), to leave the tent and stand at a
distance. I complied, of course, and presently found
myself alone with only the "officials" (eight or nine
in number) of the little native state of Jhansi. What
the finance minister wished to ask me was this&mdash;Would
I consent to leave my shoes at the door when
I entered the Ranee's apartment? I inquired if the
Governor-General's agent did so. He replied that
the Governor-General's agent had never had an interview
with the Ranee; and that the late Rajah
had never received any European gentleman in the
private apartments of the palace, but in a room set
apart for the purpose, or in the tent in which we were
conversing. I was in some difficulty, and scarcely
knew what to say, for I had a few years previously
declined to be presented to the King of Delhi, who
insisted on Europeans taking off their shoes when
they entered his presence. The idea was repugnant
to my mind, and I said as much to the minister of
the late Rajah of Jhansi; and I asked him whether
he would attend a lev√©e at the palace of the Queen
of England, if informed that he must enter her
Majesty's presence with his head uncovered, as did
all her subjects, from the lowest to the highest. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
this question he would not give me a direct answer,
but remarked, "You may wear your hat, Sahib; the
Ranee will not mind that. On the contrary, she will
regard it as an additional mark of respect towards
her." Now this was what I did not want. My desire
was, that she should consider the wearing of my
hat, supposing I consented to take off my shoes, as a
species of compromise on her part as well as on my
part. But I was so amused with this bargaining, as
it were, that I consented; giving them distinctly to
understand, however, that it was to be considered not
as a compliment to her rank and dignity, but to her
sex, and her sex alone. That great point settled, I
partook of a very sumptuous repast that was prepared
for me, and awaited patiently the setting of the sun or
the rising of the moon, determined, however, that I
would wear my hat&mdash;a black "wide-awake," covered
with a white turban.</p>

<p>The hour came, and the white elephant (an Albino,
one of the very few in all India), bearing on his immense
back a silver houdah, trimmed with red velvet,
was brought to the tent. I ascended the steps, which
were also covered with red velvet, and took my place.
The mahoot, or elephant-driver, was attired in the
most gorgeous manner. The ministers of state,
mounted on white Arabs, rode on either side of the
elephant; the Jhansi cavalry lining the road to the
palace, and thus forming an avenue. The palace was
about half a mile distant from my encampment ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere long we arrived at the gates, at which the
attendants on foot began to knock violently. A
wicket was opened, and closed hastily. Information
was then sent to the Ranee; and, after a delay of
about ten minutes, the "hookum" (order) came to
open the gates. I entered on the elephant, and
alighted in a court-yard. The evening was very warm,
and I fancied that I should be suffocated by the
crowd of natives (retainers) who flocked around me.
Observing my discomfiture, the minister imperiously
commanded them to "stand back!" After another
brief delay, I was asked to ascend a very narrow stone
staircase, and on the landing was met by a native
gentleman, who was some relative to the Ranee. He
showed me first into one room and then into another.
These rooms (six or seven), like all rooms of the kind,
were unfurnished, save and except that the floors
were carpeted; but from the ceiling punkahs and
chandeliers were suspended, and on the walls were
native pictures of Hindoo gods and goddesses, with
here and there a large mirror. At length I was led
to the door of a room, at which the native gentleman
knocked. A female voice from within inquired,
"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Sahib," was the reply. After another brief delay,
the door was opened by some unseen hand, and the
native gentleman asked me to enter, informing me,
at the same time, that he was about to leave me.
A brief delay now occurred upon my part. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
with great difficulty that I could bring myself to take
off my shoes. At length, however, I accomplished
it, and entered the apartment in "stocking feet." In
the centre of the room, which was richly carpeted,
was an arm-chair of European manufacture, and
around it were strewn garlands of flowers (Jhansi is
famous for its beautiful and sweet-smelling flowers).
At the end of the room was a purdah or curtain, and
behind it people were talking. I sat myself down in
the arm-chair, and instinctively took off my hat; but
recollecting my resolve, I replaced it, and rather
firmly&mdash;pulling it well down, so as completely to conceal
my forehead. It was a foolish resolve, perhaps,
on my part, for the hat kept the breeze of the punkah
from cooling my temples.</p>

<p>I could hear female voices prevailing upon a child
to "go to the Sahib," and could hear the child objecting
to do so. Eventually, he was "launched" into
the room; and upon my speaking kindly to the child,
he approached me&mdash;but very timidly. His dress and
the jewels on his person, satisfied me that the child
was the adopted son of the late Rajah, and the rejected
heir to the little throne of Jhansi. He was rather
a pretty child, but very short for his years, and
broad-shouldered&mdash;like most of the Mahratta children
that I have seen.</p>

<p>Whilst I was speaking to the child, a shrill and discordant
voice issued from behind the purdah, and I
was informed that the boy was the Maharajah, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
had just been despoiled of his rights by the Governor-General
of India. I fancied that the voice was that
of some very old woman&mdash;some slave or enthusiastic
retainer, perhaps; but the child having imagined that
he was spoken to, replied, "Maharanee!" and thus I
was told the error of my conclusion.</p>

<p>And now the Ranee, having invited me to come
closer to the purdah, began to pour forth her grievances;
and, whenever she paused, the women by
whom she was surrounded, set up a sort of chorus&mdash;a
series of melancholy ejaculations&mdash;such as "Woe is
me!" "What oppression!" It reminded me somewhat
of a scene in a Greek tragedy&mdash;comical as was
the situation.</p>

<p>I had heard from the vakeel that the Ranee was a
very handsome woman, of about six or seven and
twenty years of age, and I was very curious indeed
to get a glimpse of her; and whether it was by accident,
or by design on the Ranee's part, I know
not, my curiosity was gratified. The curtain was
drawn aside by the little boy, and I had a good view
of the lady. It was only for a moment, it is true;
still I saw her sufficiently to be able to describe her.
She was a woman of about the middle size&mdash;rather
stout, but not too stout. Her face must have been
very handsome when she was younger, and even now
it had many charms&mdash;though, according to my idea
of beauty, it was too round. The expression also was
very good, and very intelligent. The eyes were particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
fine, and the nose very delicately shaped.
She was not very fair, though she was far from black.
She had no ornaments, strange to say, upon her
person, except a pair of gold ear-rings. Her dress
was a plain white muslin, so fine in texture, and
drawn about her in such a way, and so tightly, that
the outline of her figure was plainly discernible&mdash;and
a remarkably fine figure she had. What spoilt
her was her voice, which was something between a
whine and a croak. When the purdah was drawn
aside, she was, or affected to be, very much annoyed;
but presently she laughed, and good-humouredly
expressed a hope that a sight of her had not lessened
my sympathy with her sufferings nor prejudiced her
cause.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I replied, "if the Governor-General
could only be as fortunate as I have been,
and for even so brief a while, I feel quite sure that he
would at once give Jhansi back again to be ruled over
by its beautiful Queen."</p>

<p>She repaid this compliment, and the next ten
minutes were devoted to an interchange of such matters.
I told her that the whole world resounded with
the praises of her beauty and the greatness of her
intellect; and she told me that there was not a corner
of the earth in which prayers for my welfare remained
unsaid.</p>

<p>We then returned to the point&mdash;her "case." I
informed her that the Governor-General had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
power to restore the country, and recognise the claim
of the adopted son, without a reference to England,
and that the most prudent course for her to adopt
would be to petition the throne, and meanwhile draw
the pension of 6000<i>l.</i> a year, under protest that it
was not to prejudice the right of the adopted son.
At first she refused to do this, and rather energetically
exclaimed: "Mera Jhansi nahin dengee" (I
will not give up my Jhansi). I then pointed out
to her, as delicately as possible, how futile would be
any opposition; and told her, what was the truth,
that a wing of a native regiment and some artillery
were within three marches of the palace; and I
further impressed upon her that the slightest opposition
to its advance would destroy her every hope,
and, in short, jeopardize her liberty. I did this
because she gave me to understand&mdash;and so did her
attorney (and my impression is that they spoke the
truth)&mdash;that the <i>people</i> of Jhansi did not wish to be
handed over to the East India Company's rule.</p>

<p>It was past two o'clock that night before I left the
palace; and ere I took my departure, I had talked
the lady into my way of thinking, except that she
would not consent to draw any pension from the
British Government.</p>

<p>On the following day I returned to Gwalior, <i>en
route</i> to Agra. The Ranee presented me with an
elephant, a camel, an Arab, a pair of greyhounds of
great swiftness, a quantity of silks and stuffs (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
production of Jhansi), and a pair of Indian shawls.
I accepted these things with great reluctance, but
the financial minister entreated me to take them,
insomuch as it would wound the Ranee's feelings if I
refused. The Ranee also presented me with a portrait
of herself, taken by a native, a Hindoo.</p>

<p>The state of Jhansi was not restored to the rule of
the Ranee, and we know that she afterwards rivalled
that fiend Nena Sahib, whose "grievance" was
identical with her own. The Government would not
recognise Nena Sahib as the adopted son and heir of
the Peishwah; the Ranee of Jhansi sought to be
recognised as the Regent during the minority of
the late Rajah's adopted son and heir.</p>

<h2>TIRHOOT, LUCKNOW, BHITOOR, ETC.</h2>


<p>It is some years since I first landed in Calcutta. I
was in no way connected with the Government, and
was consequently an "interloper" or "adventurer."
These were the terms applied by certain officials to
European merchants, indigo-planters, shopkeepers,
artisans, barristers, attorneys, and others.</p>

<p>It was not long before I made up my mind to become
a wanderer in the East. I had no occupation,
was my own master, and had a large tract of country
to roam about in. My first step was to acquire a
knowledge of Hindostanee and of Persian. By dint
of hard study, at the end of six months I found myself
capable, not only of holding a conversation, but of
arguing a point in either of these languages: and
with a light heart I took my departure from the
City of Palaces, and proceeded to Monghyr, on the
Ganges.</p>

<p>The chief civilian of that district had invited me to
spend a month with him. Every day I accompanied
my friend to his court, and thereby got some insight
into the administration of justice in India, both civil
and criminal. Here, too, I first made acquaintance
with Thugs. Several most notorious characters of
that tribe were at Monghyr&mdash;not imprisoned, but permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to move about. They had been pardoned on
condition that they would become informers, and, to
a certain extent, detectives, in the suppression of
Thuggee in the British dominions. It was a curious
feeling to be in conversation with men who had each
committed his ninety or a hundred murders&mdash;to see
the fingers that had strangled so many victims&mdash;to
watch the process, for they were good-natured enough
to act it. There was the unsuspecting traveller with
his bundle; the decoy Thug, who engaged him in
conversation; the two men, who, at the given signal,
were to seize; the executioner, standing behind with
the handkerchief, ready to strangle the victim. They
even went through the operation of searching the
"deceased," upon whom they found nothing in this
case; but they assured me this frequently happened
in reality. The reader is of course aware that it is a
part of the Thug's religion not to rob a live body.
The crime of murder must precede that of theft.
The play&mdash;the tragedy&mdash;over (to these domesticated
demons it was a mere farce), they laughed at the
solemn expression which, I doubt not, was stamped
upon my features.</p>

<p>These Thugs were permitted to have their families
at Monghyr; and one morning when I strolled down
to their camp, an old man made five children, the
eldest boy not more than eight years old, go through
the business of strangling and robbing a victim. In
one respect these urchins outdid their progenitors in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the acting. They not only went through the ceremony
of searching the dead body, but, that done, they dragged
it by the legs to a well, and, in dumb show, threw it
down, and then uttered a prayer to Heaven.</p>

<p>"Was that good?" said one of the children, running
up to me for applause and a reward. I scarcely knew
what to reply. Before I had time to give any answer,
the child's father said, "No; it was not good. You
used the handkerchief before the signal was given.
Go through it again, and remember, this time, that
you must have patience." The boys began again,
much in the same spirit that an actor and actress
would go through the strangling scene in "Othello," to
please a fastidious manager.</p>

<p>Approaching a very interesting-looking woman, of
about two-and-twenty years of age, I said to her,
"What do you think of this?"</p>

<p>She replied in a proverb: "The mango always falls
beneath the shade of the parent tree."</p>

<p>"But the crime?" said I. "What think you of
that?"</p>

<p>She looked up with as lovely a pair of eyes as ever
saw the light, smiled, and responded:</p>

<p>"Heaven will hold us all, Sahib!"</p>

<p>I was about to reason with her, but her husband,
with an expression of pride, interfered, and informed
me that she had taken eighteen lives.</p>

<p>"Twenty-one!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Eighteen only!" said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty-one!" she persisted, and ran them over
counting on her fingers the places and the dates when
the murders were committed. Her husband then
admitted that she was in the right, and, turning to
me, remarked:</p>

<p>"She is a very clever woman, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Were your victims men or women?" I said to
her.</p>

<p>"All women," she answered me. "Some old and
some young."</p>

<p>I was tempted to ask her to show me how it was
done; and after considerable coaxing she complied
with my wishes. To my surprise she was the only
actor in the scene, except the victim, with whom she
went through the process of strangling with a piece
of cord. The victim, another Thuggess, was supposed
to be sleeping when the operation was performed, and
I could not help admiring&mdash;horrible as the sight was&mdash;the
accuracy with which she performed the throes
and agony of death. To borrow an idea from Junius,
"None but those who had frequently witnessed such
awful moments could describe them so well."</p>

<p>At the house of my Monghyr friend I met a French
gentleman, an indigo-planter of Tirhoot, in Behar.
He invited me to pay him a visit, and to accompany
him in his boat. He was about to sail on the following
day. I say "sail," for at that time (the month of
August), the country was inundated, and it would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been impossible to travel by land. I accepted the
invitation, and we sailed from Monghyr to Hajeepore
without going near the Ganges for several days.</p>

<p>Monsieur Bardon, the French planter, was one of
the most accomplished and agreeable men I had ever
met, and in truth one of the greatest characters. The
hospitality of the Tirhoot planters is proverbial in
India, and I believe I might have lived in that Garden
of the East, as it is called, from that day to this, as a
welcome guest of the various planters, if I had chosen
still to be their guest. As it was, I was eight months
in the district, and then had very great difficulty in
getting away. A now celebrated officer, at that time
commanding the Irregular Cavalry at Segowlie, induced
me to visit him; and after leaving his abode,
I went to the Bettiah Rajah, who initiated me into the
mysteries of tiger-shooting. It was in the dominions
of this small chief that my hands and face were so
browned that I became far less fair than many natives
of the country. Before leaving Tirhoot, however, I
paid a visit to Rooder Singh, the Rajah of Durbungah,
the richest native perhaps in all India. He has two
hundred thousand pounds a year net revenue; and
in a tank in his palace there is lying, in gold and
silver, upwards of a million and a half sterling.
Chutter Singh, the father of the Rajah of Durbungah,
was a firm friend of the British Government during
the Nepal war. He raised a regiment of horse and
provisioned it. When asked by the authorities for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
his bill, he replied that the Government owed him
nothing.</p>

<p>After leaving the Bettiah Rajah, I proceeded to
Lucknow, where I improved myself greatly in Hindostanee.
In this city, and in Delhi, the purest is
spoken. At Lucknow I made the acquaintance of
Ally Nucky Khan (the prime minister of the King of
Oude, who is now imprisoned in Fort William), of
Wuzy Ally Khan (a celebrity of Oude, who is since
dead), and of Rugburdiall, the eldest son of the late
Shah Beharee Lall, one of the richest bankers in
India. Shah Beharee Lall is said to have died worth
seven millions in cash; but I have reason to believe
that three millions sterling was the utmost that he
died possessed of. Rugburdiall held the office of
treasurer to the King of Oude. Ally Nucky Khan
gave me the idea of a man of small mental capacity,
but of immense cunning and inordinate vanity. The
late Mr. Beechy, the King of Oude's portrait-painter,
must have taken at least a score of likenesses of Ally
Nucky, who, to say the truth, is a remarkably good-looking
personage. Wuzy Ally Khan was a tall and
handsome man of about five-and-forty. His manners
were refined, his address charming, and his bearing
altogether that of a well-bred gentleman. Of his
talents there could be no question; and he was,
moreover, a learned and well-informed man. There
could be no doubt that Wuzy Ally Khan, in point of
fact, ruled the kingdom. The conversational powers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of this man were immense, and he was both witty and
humorous. A more agreeable companion it would be
difficult to meet with in any country. When I first
made his acquaintance, he was in great favour with
the then resident at the court of Oude; but, on the
appointment of Colonel Sleeman, he fell into disrepute
with the British officials and continued so up to
the time of his death, which occurred about two years
ago. I was five months in Oude, and, during that
period, spoke nothing but Hindostanee or Persian.
I made a point of avoiding my own countrymen, and
of associating only with the natives of India.</p>

<p>Previous to leaving Lucknow, a letter was despatched
to Nena Sahib, informing him that a gentleman
of distinction, a most intimate friend of the
Governor-General, and related by birth or marriage to
every member of the council in Calcutta, as well as a
constant guest of the Queen of England, was travelling
through Hindostan in disguise, and would most
probably, by his presence, illumine the abode of
Maharajah Bahadoor, and it was hoped that every
respect would be paid to the dignity of the Sahib's
exalted position, &amp;c., &amp;c. When the draft of this epistle
was read aloud by the moonshee, who had written it
from dictation, I expostulated, on the ground that the
contents were not in accordance with the truth. My
scruples, however, were eventually overcome, and I
took leave of my Lucknow friends, after being provided
with all that I should require on my journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
(of about forty-five miles), and an escort of fifteen
sowars (horsemen); for the road, at that time, between
Lucknow and Cawnpore, was infested by robbers.
About a mile from Bhitoor my palkee was placed
upon the ground. I was asleep, but awoke, and inquired,
"Kia hua?" (What is the matter?)</p>

<p>I was informed by the bearers of my palkee that
the Maharajah Peishwa Bahadoor had sent out an
escort in honour of my approach, and presently there
appeared at the door of my palkee a soldier-like
looking Hindoo, who made me a very respectful
salaam. The escort consisted of eight foot-soldiers
with drawn swords, and four sowars. The former,
running by the side of my palkee, encouraged the
bearers to make haste; while the latter caused their
horses to curvet and prance, and thus kick up a
frightful dust. At the abode of the Maharajah Bahadoor,
I was met by several of his musahibs (courtiers),
who were exceedingly polite, and conducted me to a
suite of apartments which had apparently been made
ready for my reception; and so far as servants were
concerned, I was literally surrounded. A sirdar
bearer (personal attendant, or Indian valet) took
charge of my two boxes which contained my wearing
apparel. A khansamah (butler), followed by three
khidmutghars (table servants), asked me if I would
take some iced water, and in the same breath informed
me that every kind of European drink was at hand.
Brandy, gin, champagne, claret, sherry, port, beer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cherry-brandy, and soda-water. And what would I
take for dinner? Whatever the Sahib's heart might
desire, was in readiness. Turkey? goose? duck?
fowl? beefsteak? mutton-chop? ham and eggs?
And here the khansamah (a venerable Mussulman)
informed me, sotto voce, that the Maharajah was constantly
in the habit of entertaining European gentlemen;
and that, although his highness was himself a
strict Hindoo, he had no kind of prejudice, so that if
I preferred beef to any other kind of meat, I had
only to give the order. I assured the khansamah
that since my arrival in India, I had never tasted
beef, or hog's flesh, and that if he would have prepared
for me, as speedily as possible, some rice and
vegetables, I should be quite satisfied. With a
profound salaam the khansamah took his departure,
followed by the khidmutghars. The sirdar bearers,
and four other men, then approached me reverentially,
and begged to conduct me to my sleeping
apartment and the bathing-rooms.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly quaint about the
arrangement of European furniture in the house of a
native gentleman. In the house of an European, the
servants are, of course, taught how to arrange tables,
chairs, and beds, according to European ideas; but it
is otherwise with the servants of a rajah, or native
gentleman. The consequence is that in the dining,
or drawing-room, you will find a wash-hand stand,
and a chest of drawers, and a toilet-table, while in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
bed-room you will, perhaps, discover an old piano, an
organ, a card-table, or cheffonier. The furniture has,
for the most part, been purchased at various sales, and
has belonged to officers of all grades, civil and military.
There are the tent-table and the camp-stool of
the dead ensign, in the same room with the marble-topped
table and crimson damask covered easy chair
of some luxurious judge. On the mantelpiece you
will find a costly clock of the most elegant design
and workmanship, and on each side of it, a pair of
japan candlesticks, not worth half-a-crown. In this
way are arranged the pictures on the walls. Immediately
underneath a proof print of Landseer's
"Bolton Abbey," or "Hawking," you will observe a
sixpenny coloured print of the Duke of Wellington
or Napoleon Bonaparte. The pictures, also, have been
bought indiscriminately at various sales, and have
been as indiscriminately suspended on the walls.
There are the print-shop ballet girls intermingled with
engravings of the most serious character. Fores's sporting
collection with the most classical subjects. Foot-stools,
musical-boxes, and elegantly bound books,
writing-desks, work-boxes, plated dishes, sugar-basins,
and teapots, are arranged in the most grotesque
fashion imaginable. Upon an elegant mahogany
sideboard you will find decanters and glasses of every
description and quality. Upon another sideboard, in
the drawing-room, you will find a variety of dinner-services,
and earthen fragments thereof, all mixed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
There was but one set of rooms at Bhitoor for the reception
of "Sahib logue," and this was the set that I
then occupied.</p>

<p>I had scarcely made myself comfortable, when the
khansamah informed me that dinner was on the table.
This was welcome intelligence, for I had not tasted
food since morning, and it was half-past five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> I
sat down to a table twenty feet long (it had originally
been the mess table of a cavalry regiment), which
was covered with a damask table-cloth of European
manufacture, but instead of a dinner-napkin there
was a bed-room towel. The soup&mdash;for he had everything
ready&mdash;was served up in a trifle-dish which had
formed part of a dessert service belonging to the
9th Lancers&mdash;at all events, the arms of that regiment
were upon it; but the plate into which I ladled
it with a broken tea-cup, was of the old willow pattern.
The pilao which followed the soup, was served
upon a huge plated dish, but the plate from which
I ate it, was of the very commonest description. The
knife was a bone-handled affair; the spoon and the
fork were of silver, and of Calcutta make. The plated
side-dishes, containing vegetables, were odd ones; one
was round, the other oval. The pudding was brought
in upon a soup-plate of blue and gold pattern, and
the cheese was placed before me on a glass dish
belonging to a dessert service. The cool claret I drank
out of a richly cut champagne glass, and the beer out
of an American tumbler, of the very worst quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>I had not yet seen "the Maharajah." It was not
until past eight that a moonshee came and inquired if
I would have an interview with his highness. I replied
that it would give me great joy, and was forthwith
conducted through numerous narrow and gloomy
passages to an apartment at the corner of the building.
Here sat the Maharajah on a Turkey carpet,
and reclining slightly on a huge bolster. In front of
him were his hookah, a sword, and several nosegays.
His highness rose, came forward, took my hand, led
me to the carpet, and begged of me to be seated on a
cane-bottomed arm-chair, which had evidently been
placed ready for my especial ease and occupation. After
the usual compliments had passed, the Maharajah inquired
if I had eaten well. But, perhaps, the general
reader would like to know what are "the usual
compliments."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "The whole world is ringing with
the praise of your illustrious name."</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "Maharaj. You are very good."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "From Calcutta to Cabul&mdash;throughout
the whole of Hindoostan&mdash;every tongue declares
that you have no equal. Is it true?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib (who, if he knows anything of
Asiatic manners and customs, knows that he must not
contradict his host, but eat his compliments with a
good appetite). "Maharaj."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "The acuteness of your perceptions,
and the soundness of your understanding, have, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
universal report, became as manifest as even the light
of the sun itself." Then, turning to his attendants of
every degree, who, by this time, had formed a circle
round me and the Rajah, he put the question, "Is it
true, or not?"</p>

<p>The attendants, one and all, declare that it was
true; and inquire whether it could be possible for a
great man like the Maharajah to say that which was
false.</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "The Sahib's father is living?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "No; he is dead, Maharaj."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "He was a great man?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "Maharaj. You have honoured
the memory of my father, and exalted it in my esteem,
by expressing such an opinion."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "And your mother? She lives?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "By the goodness of God, such is
the case."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "She is a very handsome woman?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "On that point, Maharaj, I cannot
offer an opinion."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "You need not do so. To look in
your face is quite sufficient. I would give a crore of
rupees (one million sterling) to see her only for one
moment, and say how much I admired the intelligent
countenance of her son. I am going to England
next year. Will the Sahib favour me with her
address?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "Maharaj."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Here the Native Rajah calls to the moonshee to
bring pen, ink, and paper. The moonshee comes, sits
before me, pen in hand, looks inquiringly into my
eyes, and I dictate as follows, laughing inwardly all
the while: "Lady Bombazine, Munnymunt, ka uper,
Peccadilleemee, Bilgrave Isqueere, Sunjons wood-Cumberwill;"
which signifies this: "Lady Bombazine,
on the top of the Monument, in Piccadilly, Belgrave
Square, St. Johns Wood, Camberwell." This
mystification must be excused by the plea that the
Rajah's assertions of his going to Europe are as truthful
as Lady Bombazine's address.</p>

<p>The Maharajah then gives instructions that that
document shall be preserved amongst his most
important papers, and resumes the conversation.</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "The Sahib has eaten well?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "Maharaj."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "And drunk?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "Maharaj."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "The Sahib will smoke hookah?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "The Maharajah is very good."</p>

<p>A hookah is called for by the Rajah; and then at
least a dozen voices repeat the order: "Hookah lao,
Sahib ke waste." (Bring a hookah for the Sahib.)
Presently the hookah is brought in. It is rather a
grand affair, but old, and has evidently belonged to
some European of extravagant habits. Of course,
no native would smoke out of it (on the ground of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
caste), and it is evidently kept for the use of the
Sahib logue.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>While I am pulling away at the hookah, the
musahibs, or favourites of the Rajah, flatter me, in
very audible whispers. "How well he smokes!"
"What a fine forehead he has!" "And his eyes!
how they sparkle!" "No wonder he is so clever!"
"He will be Governor-General some day." "Khuda-kuren!"
(God will have it so.)</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "Sahib, when you become Governor-General,
you will be a friend to the poor?"</p>

<p>Humble Sahib (speaking from the bottom of his
heart). "Most assuredly, Maharaj."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "And you will listen to the petition
of every man, rich and poor alike."</p>

<p>Humble Sahib. "It will be my duty so to do."</p>

<p>Native Rajah (in a loud voice). "Moonshee!"</p>

<p>Moonshee (who is close at hand). "Maharaj, Protector
of the Poor."</p>

<p>Native Rajah. "Bring the petition that I have laid
before the Governor-General."</p>

<p>The moonshee produces the petition, and at the
instance of the Rajah, reads, or rather sings it aloud.
The Rajah listens with pleasure to its recital of his
own wrongs, and I affect to be astounded that so
much injustice can possibly exist. During my rambles
in India I have been the guest of some scores of
rajahs, great and small, and I never knew one who
had not a grievance. He had either been wronged
by the government, or by some judge, whose decision
had been against him. In the matter of the government,
it was a sheer love of oppression that led to
the evil of which he complained; in the matter of
the judge, that functionary had been bribed by the
other party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>It was with great difficulty that I kept my eyes
open while the petition&mdash;a very long one&mdash;was read
aloud. Shortly after it was finished, I craved permission
to retire, and was conducted by a bearer to
the sleeping-room, in the centre of which was a huge
bedstead, a four-poster, but devoid of curtains. On
either side were large looking-glasses in gilt frames,
not suspended on the walls, but placed against them.
Over the bed was a punkah, which was immediately
set in motion. The movement of the punkah served
a double purpose; it cooled the room, and drove
away the musquitoes. Having thrown myself on the
bed, the bearer, who was in attendance, inquired if
I would be shampooed. This was a luxury to which I
was always partial, and, having signified that I desired
it, four men were shouted for. Each took an
arm or a leg, and began to press it, and crack the
knuckle-joints of my fingers and toes. This continued
until I had fallen asleep. I did not wake
until eight o'clock on the following morning, when I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was waited upon by the khansamah, who wished to
know my pleasure with respect to breakfast. He
informed me that he had "Futnum and Meesum's,"
Yorkshire pie, game pie, anchovy toast, mutton-chop,
steak, sardines&mdash;in short, all that the Sahib logue
were accustomed to take.</p>

<p>My breakfast over, and my hookah smoked, I
lighted a cheroot, and walked out into a verandah,
where I was soon joined by some of the Maharajah's
favourites and dependents, who poured into my ear a
repetition of the flattery to which I had listened on
the previous night. It is not very tedious when you
become used to it, and know that it is a matter
of course, and is applied to every European guest of
any real or supposed importance. Whilst thus engaged,
smoking and listening, I was joined by the
Maharajah, who held in his hand the Delhi Gazette,
the Mofussilite, and the Calcutta Englishman. Of
their entire contents he had been made acquainted
by a half-caste, whom he kept (so he informed me)
for the sole purpose of translating, orally, into Hindostanee,
the Indian journals and the government
gazettes, published in the English language. There
was no occasion for me to read these papers, for the
Maharajah gave me a very accurate resum√© of them;
having done this, he asked me to play a game of
billiards. I am not a bad billiard-player; on the
contrary, I have the vanity to think that I play remarkably
well; but it was quite evident to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Maharajah did not play his best, and that he
suffered me to beat him as easily as I did, simply
out of what he considered to be politeness. All the
while we were playing the favourites or courtiers of
the Maharajah were praising us both. Neither of us
made a stroke, good or bad, that did not bring down
a shower of compliments. My impression is, that if
I had run a cue, and cut the cloth at the same time,
the bystanders would have shouted in praise of my
skill and execution. I had already seen enough of
native character to know exactly how I was to act.
I feigned to be charmed with my success&mdash;childishly
charmed. Whilst I was thus (to the delight of my
host) ostensibly revelling in my triumph, the marker&mdash;a
native, a Hindoo&mdash;took up a cue, and began to
knock the balls about. He cannoned all over the
table, went in off the red and white, screwed back
under the cushion, and, in short, did whatever he
pleased, and with perfect ease.</p>

<p>I could not help expressing to the Rajah my astonishment
at the Hindoo marker's skill; whereupon,
he informed me that, when he was a mere boy, he
had been taught by the best player (an officer in the
Light Cavalry) that ever came to India, and that for
several years past he had been marker at various
mess-rooms where billiards were played. The name
of this Hindoo Jonathan was Runjeet. He was six-and-twenty
years of age, about five feet five in height,
remarkably slim, had a very handsome face, and eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
full of fire and spirit. He was for a long time marker
to the Horse Artillery mess at Meerut, where I once
saw him play a game with an officer celebrated for
his skill. Runjeet gave his adversary sixty points out
of a hundred, and won easily. What with his pay,
or salary, the presents he received from gentlemen to
whom he taught the game, and the gold mohurs that
he occasionally had given to him when he won bets
for his backers, Runjeet was in possession of some
six hundred pounds a-year; but he was so extravagant
in his habits, that he spent every anna, and died, I
was told, "not worth money enough to buy the wood
to burn him."</p>

<p>The Maharajah, on leaving the billiard-room, invited
me to accompany him to Cawnpore. I acquiesced,
and the carriage was ordered. The carriage
was English-built&mdash;a very handsome landau&mdash;and
the horses were English horses; but the harness! It
was country-made, of the very commonest kind, and
worn out, for one of the traces was a piece of rope.
The coachman was filthy in his dress, and the whip that
he carried in his hand was an old broken buggy-whip,
which some European gentleman must have thrown
away. On the box, on either side of the coachman,
sat a warlike retainer, armed with a sword and a
dagger. In the rumble were two other retainers,
armed in the same manner. Besides the Rajah and
myself there were three others (natives and relatives
of the Rajah) in the vehicle. On the road the Rajah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
talked incessantly, and amongst other things that he
told me was this, in reference to the praises that I
bestowed on his equipage.</p>

<p>"Not long ago I had a carriage and horses very
superior to these. They cost me twenty-five thousand
rupees; but I had to burn the carriage and kill the
horses."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"The child of a certain Sahib in Cawnpore was
very sick, and the Sahib and the mem-Sahib were
bringing the child to Bhitoor for a change of air. I
sent my big carriage for them. On the road the child
died; and, of course, as a dead body had been in the
carriage, and as the horses had drawn that dead body
in that carriage, I could never use them again." The
reader must understand that a native of any rank considers
it a disgrace to sell property.</p>

<p>"But could you not have given the horses to some
friend&mdash;a Christian or a Mussulman?"</p>

<p>"No; had I done so, it might have come to
the knowledge of the Sahib, and his feelings would
have been hurt at having occasioned me such a loss."</p>

<p>Such was the Maharajah, commonly known as
Nena Sahib. He appeared to me not a man of
ability, nor a fool. He was selfish; but what native
is not? He seemed to be far from a bigot in matters
of religion; and, although he was compelled to be so
very particular about the destruction of his carriage
and horses, I am quite satisfied that he drank brandy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and that he smoked hemp in the chillum of his
hookah.</p>

<p>It was half-past five o'clock when we arrived at Cawnpore.
The officers, civil and military, and their wives,
were just coming out for their evening drive on the
mall. Some were in carriages, some in buggies, some
on horseback. Every soul saluted the Maharajah; who
returned the salute according to Eastern fashion&mdash;raising
the hands to the forehead. Several gentlemen
approached the carriage when it was drawn up
near the band-stand, and inquired after the Maharajah's
health. He replied that it was good and
then introduced me to them in the following manner,
and in strict accordance with the letter he had received
from Lucknow: "This Sahib who sits near me
is a great friend of the Governor-General, and is a
relation of all the members of Council&mdash;a constant
guest of the Queen of England" (then came this
addition of his own) "and of both Houses of Parliament."
I need scarcely say that I wished my Lucknow
friends had not covered me with such recommendations;
for, wherever we went, and to whomsoever
we spoke&mdash;no matter whether it was an European
shopkeeper or an official magnate of Cawnpore&mdash;I
was doomed to hear, "This Sahib who sits (or
stands) near me is a great friend," &amp;c., &amp;c. Having
exhibited me sufficiently in Cawnpore, the heads of
the horses were turned towards Bhitoor, and we were
dragged along the road at a slow pace, for the animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
were extremely fatigued. The natives of India have
no mercy on their cattle, especially their horses.
During the ride back, I was again bored with the
Rajah's grievance; and, to quiet him&mdash;for he became
very much excited&mdash;I was induced to promise that I
would talk to the Governor-General and the Council
on the subject; and that if I did not succeed in that
quarter, I would, on my return to England, take the
earliest opportunity "some day, quietly, after dinner"
(this was his suggestion), of representing to her
Majesty the exact state of the case, and that an
adopted son of a Hindoo was entitled to all the rights
and privileges of an heir born of the body. I furthermore
promised him most solemnly that I would
not speak to the Board of Control, or to the Privy
Council on the subject; for the Maharajah assured
me that he had the most positive proof that both
these institutions had eaten bribes from the hand of
the East India Company in respect of his claim.
On probing him, however, I discovered that this positive
proof was a letter from a villanous agent in
England, who had written to him to say that "the
Company had bribed the Board of Control and the
Privy Council, and that if his Highness expected to
succeed, he must bribe over the head of the Company.
Three lacs (thirty thousand pounds) would do
it all."</p>

<p>The Maharajah gave a nautch (native dance by
women) that night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning I awoke with a very bad
headache, and in a philosophic mood. The various
perfumes which had been sprinkled over my dress had
somewhat overpowered me, and it may have been that
the story told me in whispers by one of the three
slaves who came to sing me to sleep had disordered
my imagination. I was told that two women of rank
were kept in a den not far from my apartments, and
treated like wild beasts; and a third&mdash;a beautiful
young creature&mdash;had recently been "bricked up in
a wall," for no other fault than attempting to escape.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the Rajah showed me his elephants,
his camels, his horses, his dogs, his pigeons, his falcons,
his wild asses, his apes, his aviary full of birds, and all
the rest of his curiosities. Then he exhibited his guns
and pistols&mdash;by Purdey, Egg, and other celebrated
makers&mdash;his swords, and his daggers, of every country
and age, and when he had observed that he was very
happy, under the influence of some stimulant recently
imbibed, I took an opportunity of discoursing on the
vanity of human wishes, and especially with reference
to his Highness's grievance. I translated many sentiments
of Juvenal and Horace into Hindoostanee;
but, I regret to say, they had no effect on Nena
Sahib.</p>

<h2>THE UPPER PROVINCES.</h2>


<p>It is impossible for an English gentleman to take his
departure from the house of a native of India without
giving a number of testimonials, in the shape of
"letters of recommendation" addressed to no one in
particular. Nena Sahib had a book containing the
autographs of at least a hundred and fifty gentlemen
and ladies, who had testified in writing to the attention
and kindness they had received at the hands of
the Maharajah during their stay at Bhitoor. Having
expressed my satisfaction as emphatically as possible
in this book, the khansamah (house steward) demanded
a certificate, which I gave him. Then came
the bearer, the men who guarded my door, the coachman,
the grooms, the sweeper. For each and all of
these I had to write characters, and recommend them
to such of my friends as they might encounter by
accident or otherwise. It is a fearful infliction, this
character writing; but every one is compelled to go
through it.</p>

<p>I was now on my road to Agra, to pay a visit to a
schoolfellow, who was then in the civil service, and
filling an appointment in the station. It was in the
month of September that I made the journey&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
most unhealthy season of the year. Opposite to the
first d√¢k bungalow, some twelve miles from the station
of Cawnpore, I was stopped by a set of twelve
palkee bearers, who informed me that a Sahib whom
they were taking to Allyghur had been seized with
cholera, and was dying in the bungalow. I hastened
to the room and there found, stretched upon the
couch, a young officer of about nineteen years of
age.</p>

<p>His face was ashy pale, and a profuse cold perspiration
stood upon his forehead. His hands and feet
were like ice, and he was in very great pain. The
only person near him was the sweeper, who kept on
assuring me that the youth would die. As for the
youth himself he was past speech, and I was disposed
to think with the sweeper, that he was beyond cure.
I administered, however, nearly a teaspoonful of
laudanum in a wine-glass half-full of raw brandy,
and then took a seat near the patient, in order to
witness the effect. Ere long the severe pain was
allayed, and the youth fell into a profound sleep, from
which, I began to fear, he would never awake. To
have administered a smaller dose at that stage of the
disease would have been useless, for the body was on
the very verge of collapse. Nevertheless, I began to
feel the awkwardness of the responsibility which I had
taken upon myself. Presently a palanquin carriage,
propelled by bearers, came to the bungalow. An
elderly lady and gentleman alighted, and were shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
into a little room which happened to be vacant [A
d√¢k bungalow has only two little rooms.] To my
great joy I discovered that the new arrival was a doctor
of a regiment, who, with his wife, was journeying to
Calcutta. I was not long in "calling in" the doctor;
and I had the satisfaction of hearing him pronounce
an opinion that the young ensign was "all right," and
that the dose I had administered had been the means
of saving his life. How readily, to be sure, do people
in India accommodate each other. Although the
doctor and his wife were hurrying down the country,
and albeit the youth was pronounced out of danger,
they remained with me until the following afternoon;
when, having dined, we all took our departure together&mdash;the
youth and I travelling northward, the
doctor and his wife in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The night was pitchy dark; but the glare from the
torches rendered every object near to us distinctly
visible. The light, shining on the black faces of the
palkee bearers, they appeared like so many demons&mdash;but
very merry demons; for they chatted and laughed
incessantly, until I commanded them to be silent, in
order that, while we moved along the road, I might
listen to the ensign's story, which he told me in the
most artless manner imaginable.</p>

<p>"I have only been six weeks in India," he began,
"and at present only know a few words of the language.
How I came into the Bengal army was this. My
father was in the civil service of the Company, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Madras Presidency; and, after twenty-one years' service,
retired on his pension of one thousand pounds
a year, and his savings, which amounted to twenty
thousand pounds, and which were invested in five per
cent. government securities, so that his income was
two thousand a year. We lived during the winter near
Grosvenor-square: a house of which my father bought
the lease for twenty years, and the summer we used
to spend at a little place in Berkshire which he had
bought. It was only a good sized cottage, and the
land about it did not exceed three acres. But it was
a perfect gem of a residence, and quite large enough
for our family, which consisted of my father and
mother, myself, and a sister who is a year and a half
older than I am. I was at Harrow. My father intended
that I should go to Oxford, and eventually be
called to the bar. My sister had a governess, a very
clever and accomplished girl, and the most amiable
creature that ever lived. We were not an extravagant
family, and saw very little company; but we had every
comfort that a reasonable heart could desire, and I
fancy that we lived up to the two thousand pounds a
year. You see the education of myself and my sister
was a heavy item. The governess had a hundred
pounds a year, and then there was a singing-master
and a drawing master. About two years ago my
father died, and my mother became almost imbecile
from the excess of her grief. She lost her memory;
and, for days together, knew not what she was doing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Under my father's will she was entitled to all that he
died possessed of, and was appointed his sole executrix.
The house in South-street was given up, the unexpired
portion of the lease disposed of, and the little place
in Berkshire became our only home. My father's
pension of course expired when he died, and we, the
family, had now to live on the interest of the government
securities. My mother, who was as ignorant as a
child on all matters of business, was recommended to
sell her government securities, and invest the proceeds
in a joint-stock bank which was paying, and for more
than a year did pay, eight per cent. But, alas, one
wretched day the bank failed, and we were reduced
suddenly from comparative affluence to poverty. The
cottage, furniture, and all that my mother possessed,
was seized, and sold. This happened only two years
ago. Fortunately for me, my school education was
pretty well completed; but of course the idea of my
going to Oxford, and subsequently to the bar, was at
once abandoned. My sister was obliged to take a
situation as governess, in the family of a director of
the East India Company: and through that gentleman's
influence I obtained an ensigncy in the Native
Infantry. The loss of her fortune, the parting with
my sister (who is now on the Continent with the director's
family) and myself, had such an effect upon
my mother, that it was deemed necessary to place her
in an asylum; where at all events she will be taken
care of and treated with kindness. But I have my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
plans!" exclaimed the young man, who had just
escaped the jaws of death. "In ten years I will save
enough to take me home to them; for, if I study hard&mdash;and
I will do so&mdash;I may get a staff appointment,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the bearers of my palkee informed me that
two other travellers were coming down the road.
They saw the light in the distance, more than a mile
off, and they&mdash;the bearers&mdash;began to talk loudly and
argue, that it was impossible for me to hear what the
ensign was saying, and all attempts to silence them
were vain. They were discussing, as they carried us
along, whether they would exchange burdens with
the down-coming bearers, insomuch as they were
nearly midway between the stages. This is very often
done by arrangement between them, and thus, in such
cases, they get back more speedily to their homes. It
was decided that the exchange should take place, if
the other party were agreeable; for, on the down-coming
travellers nearing us, the bearers of us&mdash;the
up-going travellers&mdash;called a halt. Forthwith the
four palkees were gently lowered till they rested on
the ground. And now the chattering of the bearers
became something awful. A native of Hindostan can
settle nothing without a noise; and, as each palkee
had twelve men attached to it besides the torch-bearers
and those who carried our boxes, the number
of voices, whooping, shouting, asserting, contradicting,
scolding, and soothing, exceeded sixty. I and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
companion, the ensign, shout to them to "go on!" At
length I got out of my palkee in a rage, and not only
screamed at, but shook several of the black disputants.
Whilst thus engaged, the doors of one of the downward
palkees were opened, and a voice&mdash;that of a
lady&mdash;thus greeted me, very good humouredly.</p>

<p>"My good sir, depend upon it that you are retarding
your own progress, and ours, by attempting, so
violently, to accelerate it. Pray let them settle their
little affair amongst themselves."</p>

<p>"I believe you are quite right," I replied.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea of the hour?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is about a quarter to twelve," said I.</p>

<p>"I have lost the key of my watch; perhaps the key
of yours would fit it."</p>

<p>I hastened to my palkee, brought forth from beneath
the pillow my watch and chain; and, taking
them to the door of the lady's palkee, presented
them through the opening.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the lady, after winding up her
watch, "thanks. It does very well," and she returned
the watch and chain. I saw, by the light of the torch,
not only her hand&mdash;which was very small and pretty&mdash;but
her face, which was more bewitching still, being
lovely and young.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else you require?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Unless you happen to have with you
some fresh bread. My children, who are asleep in
the other palkee, are tired of biscuits, and I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
we shall not reach Cawnpore before mid-day to-morrow."</p>

<p>It happened that I had a loaf in my palkee, and,
with all the pleasure of which the heart of man is
capable, placed it in the hands of the fair traveller.
On this occasion she opened the doors of her palkee
sufficiently wide to admit of my having a really good
gaze at her beautiful features. She was enveloped
in a white dressing-gown, and wore a hood made of
black silk, and lined with pink. Her hair was
brushed back off the forehead; but the long dark
tresses came from behind the ears, and rested on her
covered shoulders.</p>

<p>"Are you going to Agra?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would be good enough to return two
books for me to the wife of the assistant magistrate.
They will, no doubt, afford you as much amusement
on your journey as they have afforded me. I finished
them this afternoon, and they are now an encumbrance."
With these words she handed me the
volumes, which I faithfully promised to return. By
this time the bearers had settled their affair, and were
ready to lift the palkees. I bade the fair traveller
"good night, and a safe journey." We shook hands.</p>

<p>The reader may ask, "Who was your friend?" I
did not know at the time. It was not until I had
arrived at Agra that I was informed on this head.
The books which she entrusted to my care I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
read; and, after parting with the ensign at the d√¢k
bungalow at Bewah, they were, indeed, most agreeable
companions. I have mentioned this little episode in
my journey, not because there is anything in it worth
recording, or because there is anything romantic
therewith connected; but simply to show how readily
we (Christians) in India obliged one another, albeit
utter strangers, and how gladly we assist each other,
whenever and wherever we meet. Such an episode
in the journey of a traveller in India is one of its
most commonplace incidents.</p>

<p>Since the news of the recent deplorable disasters
has reached this country, many persons have expressed
their surprise that a lady should be suffered to travel
alone with her children, or be accompanied by no
more than one female servant. The fact is, or rather
was, that, on any dangerous road, a lady utterly unprotected
was safer than a gentleman. The sex was
actually its own protection. During my stay in India,
I knew of at least a score of instances in which officers
and civilians were stopped upon the roads, plundered,
assaulted, and in one or two cases murdered, in the
Upper Provinces; but I can only bring to mind two
instances of European ladies having been molested.
This is not to be attributed to any ideas of gallantry
or chivalry on the part of marauders in the East; but
simply to the fact that they knew the perpetrators of
an offence committed against a lady would be hunted
down to the death, while the sympathies entertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
for the sufferings of a Sahib would be only those
of an ordinary character, and soon "blow over."
Even the palkee-bearers knew the amount of responsibility
that attached to them, when they bore
away, from station to station, a female burden; and,
had the lady traveller been annoyed or interrupted
by an European traveller, they would have attacked
and beaten him, even to the breaking of his bones
and the danger of his life, had he not desisted when
commanded by the lady to do so. This has happened
more than once in the Upper Provinces of India.</p>

<p>In December, eighteen hundred and forty-nine, the
road between Saharumpore and Umballah was infested
by a gang of thieves. Several officers had been
stopped, robbed, and plundered of their money and
valuables. I had been invited to Lahore, to witness
the installation of Sir Walter Gilbert and Sir Henry
Elliot as Knights Commanders of the Bath. The
danger, near a place called Juggadree, was pointed
out to me by a mail contractor, who, finding me determined
to proceed, recommended me to dress as a
lady for a couple of stages. I did so. I borrowed a
gown, a shawl, and a nightcap; and, when I came
near the dangerous locality, I put them on, and commanded
the bearers to say I was a "mem-Sahib,"
in the event of the palkee being stopped. Sure enough,
the palkee was stopped, near Juggadree, by a gang of
ten or twelve armed men, one of whom opened the
door to satisfy himself of the truth of the statement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
made by the bearers. The moment the ruffian saw
my nightcap&mdash;a very prettily-frilled one it was, lent
to me by a very pretty woman&mdash;likewise a small
bolster, which, beneath my shawl, represented a
sleeping baby, he closed the door, and requested the
bearers to take up the palkee, and proceed; ay, and
what was more, he enjoined them to be "careful of
the mem-Sahib!"</p>

<p>I have incidentally spoken of the installation of
Sir Walter Gilbert and Sir Henry Elliot, in December,
eighteen hundred and forty-nine. Eight years have
not yet elapsed, and how many of the principal
characters in that magnificent spectacle have departed
hence! Sir Walter is dead; Sir Henry is dead. Sir
Charles Napier and Sir Dudley Hill, who led them
up to Lord Dalhousie, are dead. Colonel Mountain,
who carried the cushion on which was placed the insignia
of the order is dead. And Sir Henry Lawrence
is dead; and poor Stuart Beatson. Alas! how many
of that gay throng, men and women, husbands,
fathers, wives, and daughters, who had assembled
to witness the ceremony, have perished during the
recent revolt in the Upper Provinces of India!
Those who were present on that sixth of December
eighteen hundred and forty-nine, and who, in
eighteen hundred and fifty-seven, quietly reflect
on what has occurred since, will scarcely believe
in their own existence. It must appear to them&mdash;as
it often appears to me&mdash;as a dream; a dream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in which we saw Sir Charles Napier, with his spare
form, his eagle eyes, his aquiline nose, and long grey
beard, joking Sir Dudley Hill on his corpulence and
baldness, and asking him what sort of figure he would
cut now, in leading a forlorn hope? and Sir Dudley,
proudly and loudly replying, that he felt a better man
than ever. Presently, a meek civilian, in a white
neckcloth, and ignorant of Sir Dudley's early deeds,
was so unfortunate as to put the question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> you ever lead a forlorn hope, Sir Dudley?"
a query which induced Sir Dudley Hill to groan,
previously to exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Such is fame! A forlorn hope, my dear sir! I
have led fifty!"</p>

<p>This was, of course, an exaggeration; but I believe
that Sir Dudley Hill had, in the Peninsular War, led
more forlorn hopes than any other officer in the British
army.</p>

<p>I have wandered away from the high road to Agra,
and must return to it. I parted with the ensign at
Bewah, and commenced reading the books which the
then unknown lady had entrusted to my care. The
day, towards noon, became hot, damp, and extremely
oppressive; and there was no d√¢k bungalow, or other
abode, within nine miles of me. Before long, I heard
thunder in the distance, and presently the bearers communicated
to me that a heavy storm was approaching,
and that, in order to escape its fury, they wished to
halt at a village just a-head of us. I consented, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
now hurried along the road at the rate of five miles
an hour. My palkee was placed beneath a shed, and
the bearers congregated around it. One of the
number lighted his pipe (hubble-bubble), and passed
it to his neighbour; who, after three whiffs, passed it
to the next; who, after three whiffs, sent it on, until
each had partaken of the smoke.</p>

<p>The little village, which was a short distance from
the road, contained about sixty or seventy inhabitants,
and about double that number of children of
various ages. My presence excited no small degree
of curiosity, and the whole of the villagers approached
the shed, to have a look at me. The men and
women, of course, were not alarmed, and looked on
simply with that stupidity which is characteristic of
the cultivators of the soil in the Upper Provinces of
India. But it was otherwise with the more youthful,
the children. They held aloof, and peeped from behind
their parents, as if I had been some dangerous
wild animal. My bearers wished to drive them all
away; but I forbade this, partly because I had no
desire to deprive the villagers of whatever pleasure a
long inspection of me might afford them, and partly
because I wished to sketch the group and listen to
their remarks, which were chiefly of a personal character,
and for the most part complimentary, or
intended so to be.</p>

<p>A vivid flash of lightning, and an awfully loud clap
of thunder, accompanied by a few large drops of rain,
speedily dispersed the crowd, and I was left to myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and my bearers, who now huddled themselves together
for warmth's sake. The air had become chilly, and
even I was compelled to wrap my cloak and my
blanket about my thinly-clad limbs. Another vivid
flash of lightning, and another awful clap of thunder;
then down came such hailstones as I had never seen
before, and have never seen since in the plains of
Hindostan. In size and weight they equalled those
which sometimes fall in the Himalaya mountains in
June and July. With these storms the rains usually
"break up," and then the cold weather sets in, and
with this season of the year, what climate in the
world is superior to that of the Upper Provinces of
India? When the thunder, lightning, and hail had
ceased, and their continuance did not exceed fifteen
minutes, the sun came out, and the face of heaven
was as fair as possible, but the earth gave evidence of
the severity of the storm. Not only was the ground
covered with leaves and small branches, intermingled
with the hail, but cattle and goats had been killed by
the furious pelting of the huge stones; whilst the
electric fluid had descended on one of the mud huts
of the village in which I had taken refuge, and had
stretched out in death an old man and two of his
grandchildren, a boy of six years of age, and a girl of
four. The parents of these children were absent from
the village, and were not expected to return until
the evening. On being informed of the accident, I
expressed a desire to see the bodies, and was conducted
by several of the villagers to the hut in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
were lying. I recognised at once the features of the
old man who was a prominent figure in my sketch,
and of one of the children, the little girl who held the
old man so tightly by the hand while she peeped at
me. The face of the boy had not struck me. There
they were lying dead, but still warm, and their limbs,
as yet, devoid of rigidity. The matter-of-fact way in
which the natives of India regard the death of their
relations or friends is something wonderful to behold.
It is not that their affections are less strong than
ours, or their feelings less acute. It is that fatality
is the beginning and end of their creed. They are
taught from their childhood to regard visitations of
this character as direct and special acts of God&mdash;as
matters which it is not only futile, but improper to
bewail. None of the villagers&mdash;men, women, or
children, exhibited any token of grief while gazing
on the lifeless bodies they surrounded. And, on
asking my bearers whether the parents of the children
would weep when they returned, and found their
offspring thus suddenly cut off, they replied, rather
abruptly, "Why should they weep at God's will?"</p>

<p>As I was preparing to leave the village, a middle-aged
woman came up to me, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sahib, the parents of the dead children are very
poor, and the expense of burning their remains will
press very hard upon them. The wood for the old
man will cost eight annas, and the fuel for each of the
children four annas; in all, one rupee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>I placed the coin in the woman's hand, and left,
besides, a donation for the bereaved parents who were
absent; having previously called several of the villagers
to witness the proceeding. This I did at the
suggestion of the palkee bearers, who entertained
some doubts of the woman's honesty. We had not
proceeded far, when I descried a small encampment
beneath a clump of mango trees. It consisted of an
officer's tent, and two long tents for native soldiers&mdash;Sepoys.
One of these long tents was for the Hindoos,
the other for the Mussulmans. When we came
opposite to the encampment, I desired the bearers to
stop, and to put some questions to a Sepoy who was
standing near the road. I gleaned from him that
the encampment was that of "a treasure party," consisting
of a Lieutenant, and a company of native
infantry, proceeding from Mynpoorie to Agra.</p>

<p>"Won't you go and see the Sahib?" asked the Sepoy.</p>

<p>"I don't know him," said I.</p>

<p>"That does not signify," said the Sepoy. "Our
Sahib is glad to see everybody. He is the most light-hearted
man in Hindostan. His lips are the home of
laughter, and his presence awakens happiness in the
breast of the most sorrowful. His body is small, but
his mind is great; and, in his eyes, the Hindoo, the
Mussulman, and the Christian, are all equal."</p>

<p>This description, I confess, aroused my curiosity to
see so philosophical a Lieutenant, and it was not long
before my curiosity was gratified; for he made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
appearance at the door of his tent; and, observing
my palkee, bore down upon it.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant wore a pair of white pyjamahs,
which were tucked up to his knees, no shoes or stockings;
a blue shirt, no coat, no jacket; a black necktie,
and a leather helmet with a white covering, such
as one sees labelled in the shop-windows "for India."
His person was very small certainly, and the calves of
his legs not bigger than those of a boy of twelve years
of age. In his mouth he had a huge (number one)
cheroot, and in his hand, a walking-stick, with a waist
nearly as big as his own. Resting his chest upon this
walking-stick, and looking me full in the face, perfectly
ignorant, and seemingly indifferent, as to
whether I might be a secretary to the government, or
a shopkeeper, he thus familiarly accosted me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, old boy, how do you feel after the shower?"</p>

<p>"Very well, I thank you."</p>

<p>"Come in and have a cup of tea, and a round of
toast, if you are not in a hurry to get on. It will set
you up, and make you feel comfortable for the night."
This offer was so tempting, and so cordially made,
that I was induced to accept it.</p>

<p>"Bring the Sahib into my tent, in the palkee," said
Lieutenant Sixtie to my bearers; and then addressing
me, he remarked&mdash;"Don't get out. You'll wet
your slippers."</p>

<p>The bearers followed the Lieutenant, and put down
my palkee upon two tiers of small boxes, which were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
spread over the space of ground covered by the
tent.</p>

<p>"I was obliged to resort to this box dodge," said
my host, "or I should have been drowned. I wish I
owned only a quarter of this rhino we are treading on.
If I did, catch me at this work any longer, my masters!"
It was the treasure that the boxes contained,
in all about twenty-five thousand pounds. "Look
here, old boy. Forego, like a good fellow, the tea
and the toast. My servants will have such a bother
to get a fire and boil water. Have some biscuits and
cold brandy-and-water instead. You should never
drink tea while travelling. It keeps you awake;
and, what is more, it spoils the flavour of your
cheroots. By the bye, have one of these weeds."</p>

<p>I thanked my host; and, without any sort of
pressing, yielded to his every wish&mdash;even unto
playing <i>√©cart√©</i> with him, while smoking his cheroots
and drinking his brandy-and-water. The stakes
were not very high. Only a rupee a game. During
the deals, my host would frequently exclaim:</p>

<p>"By Jove! what a godsend it is to have some one
to talk to for a few hours! I have been out for five
days; and, during that time, have not uttered a
word in my own language. Haven't had the luck to
come across a soul. This escorting treasure is the
most awful part of an officer's duty, especially at this
season of the year."</p>

<p>"But it must be done," I suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. But why not by native officers?"</p>

<p>"Would the treasure be safe with them?"</p>

<p>"Safe? Just as safe as it is now, if not safer; for,
although I am responsible for the money in these
boxes, I don't know that the whole amount is here.
I didn't count it; and, if there was any deficiency,
I should say so. Now, a native officer would satisfy
himself on the subject before he took charge. Don't
you see?"</p>

<p>Here our conversation was interrupted by a havildar
(native sergeant), who appeared at the door of
the tent, saluted the Lieutenant, and uttered in a
deep and solemn tone of voice the word Sa-hib!</p>

<p>"Well. What's the matter?" said the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Maun Singh Sipahee is very ill."</p>

<p>"What ails him?"</p>

<p>"He has fever."</p>

<p>"Then I will come and see him in one moment."
With these words the Lieutenant threw down his
cards, and invited me to accompany him to the tent
wherein the patient was lying.</p>

<p>Maun Singh Sipahee was a powerful Brahmin, who
stood upwards of six feet two. He was a native of
Oude, and had a very dark skin. When we entered
the tent, he attempted to rise from the charpai (native
bedstead) on which he was reclining; but the Lieutenant
told him to be still, then felt the sick man's
pulse, and placed his small white hand across the
broad black forehead of the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Carry him into my tent. The ground is too
damp for him here," said the Lieutenant; and forthwith
the bedstead was raised by half-a-dozen of the
man's comrades. In the tent medicine was administered&mdash;a
small quantity of tartar emetic dissolved
in water, and given in very small doses, until nausea
was produced, and a gentle perspiration stood upon
the skin of the patient.</p>

<p>"You are all right, now, Maun Singh," said the
Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"No, Sahib, I am dying. Nothing can save me."</p>

<p>"Then you know better than I do?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Listen. Lie very quiet; and, before we march, I
will give you another sort of medicine that will set
you up."</p>

<p>The Sepoy covered his head over with his resaiee
(counterpane), and lay as still as possible.</p>

<p>"They always fancy they are going to die, if there
is anything the matter with them," said the Lieutenant
to me. "I have cured hundreds of fever cases by
this treatment. The only medicines I ever use in fever,
sir, are tartar emetic and quinine. He has taken the
one, which has had its effect; the other he shall have
by and bye. I wouldn't lose that man on any
account. His death would occasion me the greatest
grief."</p>

<p>"Is he a great favourite?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not more than any of the rest of them who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with the regiment at Affghanistan, where they not
only proved themselves as brave as the European
soldiers, but where they showed themselves superior
to prejudices most intimately connected with their
religion&mdash;their caste. That man, whom you see lying
there, is a Brahmin of the highest caste; yet, I have
seen him, and other Brahmins now in my regiment,
bearing upon their shoulders the remains of an officer
to the grave. Of course, you are aware that to do a
thing of that kind&mdash;to touch the corpse of an unbeliever&mdash;involves
a loss of caste?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, these fellows braved the opinion and the
taunts of every Hindoo in the country, in order to
pay respect to the memory of those officers whose
dangers and privations they had cheerfully shared.
You are aware, perhaps, that at last the government
found it necessary to issue a general order to the
effect that any Sepoy of any other regiment who
insulted the men of this regiment, by telling them
they had lost their caste, would be severely punished
and dismissed the service? Such was the case, sir;
and many courts-martial were held in various stations
for the trial of offenders against this order; and many
Hindoo Sepoys and Mussulman native officers were
very severely dealt with. And the thing was put
down, sir; and now-a-days there is nothing more
common than for the Hindoo Sepoys, in all the regiments,
to ask permission to carry the remains of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
popular officer to the grave. Indeed, ladies are often
thus honoured, and children. They seem to have
agreed amongst themselves that this does not involve
a loss of caste. So much for caste, if it can be got
over by an understanding amongst themselves!
Caste! More than four-fifths of what they talk
about it is pure nonsense and falsehood, as any
straightforward native will confidentially confess to
you. I don't mean to say that some Hindoos are
not very strict. Many, indeed, are so. But I mean
to say that a very small proportion live in accordance
with the Shasters, and that when they cry out, "if we
do so and so we shall lose our caste," it is nothing
more than a rotten pretext for escaping some duty,
or for refusing to obey a distasteful order. There are
hypocrites in all countries, but India swarms with
them more thickly than any country in the world.
And the fact is that we foster hypocrisy. Our fellows,
and most of them Brahmins, released a good many cats
from the bag, when they were taunted with having
lost their caste! If you are not in a frightful hurry
to get on, stay till we march, and go with us; and I'll
tell you and show you something more about caste.
You can send on your palkee and bearers to the next
encampment ground, and I'll drive you in my old
trap of a buggy. It is not a remarkably elegant
affair, but it is very strong and roomy. By the bye,
we shall have to travel 'three in a gig;' for I must
put Maun Singh, my sick Sepoy, between us; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
you will find him a very intelligent fellow, I can tell
you, and the dose I intend giving him will make him
as chirpy as possible."</p>

<p>The conversation and the manners of the Lieutenant&mdash;free
and easy as were the latter&mdash;had fascinated
me, and I accepted his invitation.</p>

<h2>MARCHING.</h2>


<p>The small but heavy boxes containing the rupees
were placed upon the hackeries (native carts), and
the treasure party was now ready to march to the
next encampment. The night was warm, and the
Sepoys in what might strictly be termed half-dress.
They wore their red cloth coats and their chacos;
but their lower clothing was purely native; a dhotee
(narrow strip of thick calico) wound round their
loins, and falling in graceful folds about and below
the knees. Some sat upon the boxes of treasure:
others, not in line or military order, walked by the side
thereof. The Lieutenant, Maun Singh, and myself
brought up the rear. A syce (native groom) led the
horse, and thus saved the Lieutenant the trouble of
driving. The buggy was not, certainly, a very elegant
affair. It was of very ancient construction, and the
lining was entirely worn out; nor had the panels
been painted for some years. The Lieutenant told
me that he had bought this vehicle at a sale, five
years previously, for the sum of five pounds, and
that since that time it had travelled (marched, was the
word he used) all over Bengal. The harness was of
Cawnpore make; and, when new, had cost only two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
pounds ten shillings. Cawnpore, until recently, was
chiefly famous for its harness, boots and shoes, bottle-covers,
cheroot-cases, helmets, and other articles made
of leather. A nest of Chinese settled in the bazaar
many years ago and introduced the manufacture of
such matters. The horse which drew the buggy had
been a caster; that is to say, a horse considered no
longer fit for the cavalry or horse artillery, and sold by
public auction, after being branded with the letter R
(signifying rejected) on the near shoulder. He was a
tall, well-bred animal; and, according to the Lieutenant's
account, had won no end of races since the day he
had been knocked down to the Lieutenant for sixteen
rupees, or one pound twelve shillings. The fault, or
rather the misfortune, for which this animal had been
dismissed the Company's service, was total blindness
of one eye, and an inability to see much out of the
other.</p>

<p>"But, he is a ripper, nevertheless," said the
Lieutenant, touching the animal very gently with
the whip, and making him hold his head up; "and
will put some more money in my pocket next cold
weather, I hope. He is entered for the Merchant's
Plate, gentlemen riders, sir, and I am his jockey."
I expressed a hope that he would be successful.</p>

<p>It was a moonlight night, and slow as was the pace
at which we proceeded, I never so much enjoyed a
ride in my life. The scene altogether was highly
picturesque, and, as far as I was concerned, had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
wonderful charm of novelty; while it was impossible
not to be extremely entertained by the volubility and
lightheartedness of my military friend, who, notwithstanding
he had extracted from me that I did
not belong to the civil service or the army, had refrained
from inquiring my name or pursuit, and invariably
addressed me as Old Boy, albeit my years were
certainly not in excess of his own.</p>

<p>"Well, Maun Singh!" cried the Lieutenant, "how
do you feel now?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, but very weak," was the Sepoy's
reply.</p>

<p>"Then you must have a little drop of weak brandy-and-water.
Hold hard, syce, and give me the suraiee
(water-bottle)."</p>

<p>The brandy-and-water was mixed in a silver
tumbler, and handed to Maun Singh, who, <i>as soon
as the groom went again to the horse's head</i>, applied
it to his lips, and drank, without any scruple. On
the contrary, it struck me that he liked the liquor.</p>

<p>"You have lost your caste," said the Lieutenant,
jocularly. "You ought to have drunk it, you know,
as medicine, out of your own lota (brass vessel)."</p>

<p>This observation&mdash;made with a view to draw the
Sepoy out for my edification&mdash;had its effect. It
was thus Maun Singh discoursed, while the Lieutenant
and myself smoked our cheroots on either side
of him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Sahib logue believe everything that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
natives tell them about caste, and the consequence is
they believe a great many falsehoods. If I could
lose my caste by drinking medicine out of this
tumbler, I would lose it by drinking it out of my
own cup, because it came out of a bottle which you
have handled, and perhaps some drops of it touched
your fingers, while you were pouring it from one
vessel to the other. Empty a bottle of brandy or
gin into your chillumchee (brass wash-hand basin),
and tell one of your palkee-bearers to throw it away.
He and his companions will drink it, but not in your
presence. Ask the same man to drink the liquor
from your tumbler. He will put his hands together,
and implore you to excuse him, as he would lose his
caste."</p>

<p>"But is it not forbidden in the Shasters?" said I.</p>

<p>"There is no mention of brandy in the Shasters,
Sahib," returned Maun Singh, with some humour.
"The Shasters are silent on the subject. But, supposing
that it were forbidden; do not men of
every religion frequently and continually depart
from the tenets thereof, in minor things, or construe
them according to their own inclination or convenience,
or make some sort of bundobust (agreement)
with their consciences? Indeed, if we did not make
this bundobust, what Hindoo or Mussulman would
come in contact at all with one another, or with
Christians, and certainly we, the natives of India,
would not serve as soldiers."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"Because we should be in continual dread of having
our bodies contaminated and our souls placed beyond
the reach of redemption&mdash;and who would submit to
that for so many rupees a-month? Who can say what
animal supplies the skin which is used for our chacos
and accoutrements? The cow, or the pig? The
Mussulmans, when we laugh together about it, say
the cow. We protest that it is pigskin."</p>

<p>"And how do you usually settle these disputes?"
I inquired, with an eagerness which seemed to amuse
the Sepoy.</p>

<p>"O, Sahib!" he replied, "it would be a pity to
settle any dispute of that kind, since it always affords
us some merriment on a long march. When Pertab
Singh came down to Barruckpore to corrupt the regiments
of native infantry there stationed, in eighteen
hundred and forty-eight, he wanted them to protest
against wearing the chacos."</p>

<p>"And how was he received?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"They listened to him as long as his money lasted,
and then made known to their officers what he was
about."</p>

<p>"And who was Pertab Singh?"</p>

<p>"A relation of the Ranee of Lahore."</p>

<p>"And had he money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and distributed freely."</p>

<p>Here the Lieutenant informed me of the particulars
relating to the mission of Pertab Singh, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
simply to excite the native troops to mutiny and to
kill their officers; but the plot was happily discovered
by the information given by the Sepoys of the 16th
Grenadiers. "There was an investigation, but the
government deemed it best to treat the whole affair
as a farce, and Pertab Singh was looked upon as a fool
and a madman, and eventually set at liberty. It was
said that the Sepoys who gave the information were
to receive an order of merit; they had no reward at
all, however, beyond some expressions of praise from
the authorities."</p>

<p>Suddenly, the treasure party halted, and all the
Sepoys were speedily congregated beneath a mango
tree.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" cried the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Adjutant Bargow Sahib's grave," said Maun
Singh. "Do you not remember the spot?"</p>

<p>"I did not, in this light," said the Lieutenant,
alighting from the buggy, followed by myself and
Maun Singh. "Yes; here he rests, poor fellow&mdash;one
of the best and bravest beings that ever breathed.
He died suddenly one morning when we were encamped
here. He was a great favourite with the
men, as you may judge from the respect paid by
those now present to the spot where his ashes
repose."</p>

<p>One of the Sepoys suddenly began to call down
curses on the head of some sacrilegious thief. He had
discovered that the piece of marble which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
let into the head of the chunam (plaster) tomb, and
on which was cut the name, age, and regiment of the
deceased, had been abstracted.</p>

<p>"Ah! that of course," said the Lieutenant. "It is
always the case. They steal the bit of marble to make
a currystone&mdash;a stone on which they grind the ingredients
for a curry. It was not worth more than a
shilling, intrinsically; but if it had only been worth one
anna, or a quarter of an anna&mdash;half a farthing&mdash;they
would have carried it away all the same, just as they
steal pieces of iron and lead from the stone bridges,
and thus do immense mischief. All along the Grand
Trunk Road you will find the stones used for headstones
carried away from the graves."</p>

<p>The march, thirteen miles, occupied us five hours,
so slowly did the bullocks crawl along with the treasure.
It was about four o'clock when we came to the
ground&mdash;the hour at which, in strictness, the Lieutenant
should have started; but he informed me that
when on separate duty, he took a good deal of responsibility
on himself, and without detriment to the
interests of government, suited his own convenience
and that of his men. He therefore preferred making
night work of the business, and having the whole day
at his own disposal.</p>

<p>"Send your bearers away, and spend the day with
me," said the lighthearted Lieutenant. "You can get
other bearers at any of the villages in the neighbourhood;
or, if you are not in a violent hurry, march the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
whole distance to Agra with me. I can stick your
palkee and boxes on the top of the treasure, you
know."</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation with pleasure, and entered
the tent, where we found tea and biscuits ready. After
partaking of this refreshment we threw ourselves down
on charpoys (native bedsteads), and soon fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>We slept till ten, when we arose, had breakfast,
consisting of&mdash;the old story&mdash;grilled fowl, curried
fowl, and eggs, with beer instead of tea; and then we
went out and sat under the mango trees, which formed
a dense shade over the encampment. The Lieutenant
had with him a pellet bow, and was shooting at the
squirrels, which abound in the Upper Provinces of
India. While he was thus employed a Sepoy&mdash;a
Brahmin&mdash;called out: "Sahib, you have no right to
do that. It is written in the general orders that you
must respect the religious feelings of the Hindoos,
and here are you wantonly destroying the life of
animals in our presence. I shall report this to the
Colonel Sahib, when we return to the regiment."</p>

<p>From the tone in which the Sepoy spoke, I thought
he was in earnest. The Lieutenant, however, assured
me that he was only ridiculing one of those absurd
general orders which frequently appear, but of which
bad and discontented Sepoys often take advantage.
Ere long this Brahmin, observing that the light of the
Lieutenant's cheroot was extinguished, brought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
some fire. The Lieutenant gravely shook his head,
and said&mdash;"No; it is written in general orders that
no officer shall employ for his own purposes a Sepoy
who is a soldier and not a servant, and that any officer
so offending will subject himself to be tried by a court
martial." Then, taking the fire from the hand of the
Brahmin, he remarked to me&mdash;"The consequence of
that order, for which there never was the slightest
occasion, is simply this: those men who are willing
to oblige their officers laugh at it, while the disaffected
will insolently quote it if required only to pick up a
glove or a walking-stick. Many an officer has been
severely reprimanded for asking a Sepoy to carry a
letter for him to the post office."</p>

<p>It was a very pretty scene, that encampment. The
tents; the arms piled in front of them; the horse
under a tree, and his syce seated near him; the old
buggy and harness not far off; the Sepoys in groups
employed in cooking their food for the mid-day meal;
the numbers of brass vessels lying about in all directions;
the score of squirrels hopping from branch to
branch, or running up and down the trunks of the
trees; the crows, the minars, and the sparrows on the
look out for crumbs; the bullocks taking their rest
after the fatigues of the past night; and then, before
as well as after the meal, the men crowding round the
well, and washing themselves from head to foot, and
washing also their under garments, which are speedily
dried in the sun of that climate. It is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
witness and not admire this part of the Hindoo and
Mussulman religions.</p>

<p>After one o'clock, when every man had enjoyed his
smoke, there was scarcely a soul, except myself and
the Lieutenant, awake in the encampment. All were
fast asleep in the open air. The Asiatic must sleep
after his mid-day meal, if it be only for half an
hour. The loss of this little sleep is a very severe
privation.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the encampment was again all life.
Some of the Sepoys wrestled, and exhibited amazing
skill and strength in the art. To an European it is a
mystery how men who live upon nothing but farinaceous
food can be so muscular and powerful.
Others smoked their pipes (small hookahs), and
played at a native game called puchesee, resembling
lotto; while a goodly number congregated around a
Mussulman, who was reading aloud the Bagh-o-Bahar,
a Hindoostanee work of great celebrity. Two or three
of the company were musical, and played alternately
on the sitarre (native guitar or violin), accompanied
by the tom-tom (native drum), and the voices of those
who were disposed and able to sing. As for the Lieutenant
and myself we beguiled the time in conversation
and with <i>√©cart√©</i>. Towards sunset a palkee d√¢k
carriage was reported to be in sight, coming down the
road. "Hooray!" cried the Lieutenant; "come
along! let us board him. I am in want of a few
small matters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before the d√¢k carriage was abreast
of the encampment.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted the Lieutenant to the driver,
who instantly pulled up. "Whom have you got
inside?"</p>

<p>Before the driver had time to reply, the door was
slided open, and an elderly gentleman, rubbing his
eyes with his knuckles, put out his night-capped head,
and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hulloa!"</p>

<p>"What! have we woke you out of your sleep, old
boy?" said the Lieutenant, laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the old boy, very good-humouredly,
"what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Only to ask you how you are."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty well," was the reply, "but half choked
with the dust."</p>

<p>"What's taking you down the country?"</p>

<p>"Urgent private affairs."</p>

<p>"Going to be married, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, you have just guessed it."</p>

<p>"Make my most respectful salaam to your intended,
will you?"</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"When do you expect to reach Cawnpore?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>"</p>

<p>"And how do you stand affected for liquors and
weeds? Do you want anything, old boy? Brandy,
beer, soda-water? Say the word."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing; I have more in the well here than I
shall be able to consume."</p>

<p>"Then I'll trouble you for the surplus; for I am
very short, and cannot get anything till I reach
Agra, while you can replenish at every station, you
know."</p>

<p>"All right, my child," exclaimed the old boy; and,
with the greatest cheerfulness, he alighted and began
to unpack his stores. From these, the Lieutenant
took six bottles of beer, two bottles of brandy, a dozen
of soda-water, and three hundred Manilla cheroots.
This done, the old boy expressed a desire to push on;
but the Lieutenant detained him for at least ten
minutes with a series of questions, several of which
(I thought), were somewhat impertinent; for instance,
he inquired his intended's name? whether she was
tall, short, or of the middle height? what was the
colour of her hair and eyes? good-looking, and accomplished?
And to all these questions, the old boy responded
with as serious an air as if the Lieutenant had
a perfect right to put them.</p>

<p>At last the old boy proceeded on his journey.</p>

<p>"Do you know him?" I inquired of the Lieutenant,
as the carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," was the reply; "he is a Major commanding
a native infantry regiment at Banda. He is
a very good fellow, and has heaps of property; but a
frightful fool, except in the way of money-making,
and at that he is awfully clever. I first made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
acquaintance in Affghanistan. He was then in the
commissariat department, and was only taken out of
that department about a year ago, when he attained
his majority. He knows nothing whatever of soldiering,
having been in staff employ ever since he was an
ensign. All the Sepoys, as well as his officers, laugh
<i>at</i> him as he comes on the parade ground and attempts
to handle the regiment; and, after the farce is over,
he laughs <i>with</i> them. For thirty years he was employed
in commissariat duties, in which he is very
efficient. At the expiration of that period, he became
a Major; and then, according to the rules of the service,
he was withdrawn from staff employ, and appointed
to command a corps!"</p>

<p>"Surely you are jesting?"</p>

<p>"On my honour, I am serious. That is a part of
our military system, sir."</p>

<p>Here our conversation was interrupted by the approach
of the Soubadhar&mdash;native commissioned officer&mdash;who
pronounced in a deep, sonorous, but feeble and
inarticulate voice, that familiar word "Sahib!" or, as
more commonly pronounced, "Sarb!"</p>

<p>"Well, old man, what is the matter?" said the
Lieutenant to the almost imbecile native veteran, who
had served in the time of Lord Lake, and who ought
to have been pensioned many years previously, despite
any remonstrances against such a measure. The old
man forthwith began to detail a string of grievances,
which the Lieutenant faithfully (?) promised to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
remedied, albeit he could understand but a few words
the old man said&mdash;so very indistinct was his speech,
from sheer old age, and the loss of his teeth.</p>

<p>"A grievance, real or imaginary, is quite necessary
for that old man's existence," said the Lieutenant;
"and if he can't find one for himself (which is a very
rare circumstance), he will concoct one for the Sepoys.
To make grievances is the end and object of that old
man's life; and, I am sorry to say, that he is a perfect
representative of the entire body of native commissioned
officers, who are, generally speaking, despised
by the men of the regiment, as well as by the
European officers. These are the gentlemen who
brew or ferment all the mischief that occasionally
occurs in native regiments. They suggest to the men
to make all sorts of extortionate demands, just as a
regiment is on the point of marching. That old man's
present grievance, as far as I could collect, is that the
water is very bad here, at this encampment ground,
and that government ought to have a new well sunk.
He happens just now to be suffering severely from
one of the very many ailments consequent on his time
of life, and he attributes it to the water."</p>

<p>"Which happens to be very good," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Precisely so. These native officers, of every rank
and grade, are, in my opinion, the curse of the native
service. Many very clear-headed and experienced
officers have recommended doing away with them, and
appointing in their stead more European officers; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the advice has never been heeded, and never will be,
I fear."</p>

<p>It was not until midnight that the little camp was
broken up, and we resumed the march towards Agra.
During the drive, the Lieutenant entertained me by
relating a number of stories connected with the war in
Affghanistan. Several of them interested me exceedingly;
one, in particular. It was this; which I
now give in the Lieutenant's own words, as nearly as
I can recollect them.</p>

<p>"About a year ago," said he, "I was passing through
Meerut, on my way from the Hills, whither I had been
on sick certificate, and was putting up for a few days
with my friend Richards, of the Light Cavalry&mdash;a
man whom I had known during that disastrous campaign
to which this narrative has reference. One
morning, after breakfast, there came to the bungalow
of my friend an Affghan, who was a dealer in dried
fruits&mdash;such as grapes, apples, and pomegranates,&mdash;and
inquired if the Sahib or mem Sahib was in want
of any of these commodities, which he had just
brought from Caubul. My friend's wife, who had
also been in Affghanistan, and spoke the mongrel
Persian current in that country, replied in the affirmative,
and the Affghan was admitted to the verandah
to exhibit his specimens and declare his prices. To
talk to these dealers is rather amusing at times,
especially when you know their habits, and customs,
and peculiarities, as well as their language. To people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who have been in their country, it is like meeting with
an old friend, and one lingers as long as possible over
the business of the bargain and sale. And so was it
this morning. We had him for at least an hour in
the verandah before my friend's wife would decide
upon what she would take. This matter concluded,
the Affghan inquired if the lady would buy a kitten&mdash;a
Persian kitten; kittens being also a commodity
with these travelling Affghans.</p>

<p>"'Yes; where are the kittens?' said the lady.</p>

<p>"'Here,' said the merchant, putting his hand into
a huge pocket at the back of his chogah (a sort of
gaberdine), and withdrawing, one by one, no less than
sixteen of these little animals (all males). For more
than the hour which was consumed in negotiating
about the fruit, and talking on other subjects, this
living bustle had remained perfectly motionless, and
had not uttered a single sound; but now, when they
saw the light, and were placed upon all-fours, they
ran about and mewed&mdash;bushy tails on end&mdash;after the
most vigorous fashion imaginable. There they were!
Kittens as black as the blackest ink, kittens white as
the whitest snow, kittens as yellow as the yellowest
gold, and kittens piebald, brindled, and grey.</p>

<p>"'There, mem Sahib; take your choice. Twenty
rupees (two pounds) each.'</p>

<p>"The lady selected one of the white and one of
the black kittens, and for the two he was induced to
accept thirty-five rupees (three pounds ten shillings).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
This may seem a large sum of money to give for a
brace of young cats; but it must be remembered that
they came from Bokhara, and were of the purest breed
that could possibly be procured.</p>

<p>"The Affghan dealer took his leave, and promised
to send the fruits in the course of the day. He fulfilled
his promise; at tiffin-time there came a boy of
about eleven years of age, bearing the basket containing
them upon his head, which was shawled after
the fashion of the Affghan people. The boy was
admitted to the room. No sooner was he shown in,
than his exceedingly beautiful countenance, and its
peculiar expression, riveted the attention of all of us,
and we put to him a variety of questions which he
answered with great intelligence, and in a tone of
voice so soft and silvery that even the guttural sounds
he uttered came like music on the ear.</p>

<p>"'Look into that boy's face,' said the lady to her
husband and myself; 'observe his every feature, and
his teeth,&mdash;regard especially his smile,&mdash;yes, and even
the shape of his fingers, and then tell me of whom he
is the very image.'</p>

<p>"'I know,' said my friend.</p>

<p>"'So do I,' exclaimed your humble servant.</p>

<p>"'Stay!' said the lady, energetically. 'Do not
speak; but let each of us write the name on a slip of
paper, and see if we agree;' and tearing up an envelope
and taking a tiny pencil-case from her watch-chain,
she wrote a name upon one slip, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
handed to me and to her husband, respectively, a slip
and the pencil-case. When we had each written a
name, we compared them,&mdash;and they did not agree
exactly. My friend and his wife had written Captain
Percy &mdash;&mdash;, and I had written Mrs. Percy &mdash;&mdash;.
That the boy was the offspring of that unfortunate
couple (cousins), who perished in that campaign, and
of whose young child no one ever knew what had
become, we were all quite satisfied; and our reflections
became extremely melancholy.</p>

<p>"We questioned the boy as to his parentage, his
relation to the Affghan dealer in cats and fruit, and
on a variety of other matters. His replies were
simply to the effect that he was an orphan and a
slave; that he knew not the place of his birth, but
believed it was Affghanistan; that he was a Mahommedan,
and that his earliest recollections were associated
with Caubul.</p>

<p>"Whilst we were thus interrogating the boy, the
Major of my friend's regiment, accompanied by his
wife, drove up to the door. They had come to pay a
visit. When asked to look at the boy, and say to
whom he bore a resemblance, they at once declared,
'Poor Percy &mdash;&mdash;!' Several officers of the regiment
were sent for. They came, and immediately on seeing
the boy expressed an opinion that he was the
child of the unfortunate officer whose name has been
partially recorded. The poor boy, meanwhile, exhibited
some anxiety to return to his master. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
he was detained and further questioned as to the
manner in which he was treated. He confessed that
his master was rather severe, but withal a very good
man.</p>

<p>"It was resolved to summon the Affghan dealer
and make him render an account of the boy, and of
how he became possessed of him. For this purpose
a messenger was dispatched, and enjoined to make
haste.</p>

<p>"The Affghan dealer came, and was cautioned
that he must speak the truth; whereupon&mdash;as is the
custom in India from one end to the other&mdash;he declared
that he never spoke falsely, and that he would
rather have his tongue torn out. This little preliminary
over, the examination (which was conducted by
the Major of the regiment, a very shrewd and clever
man, and who, by the way, was distantly related to
the unfortunate couple to whom the boy bore such a
strong resemblance) commenced:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Who is this boy?'</p>

<p>"'He belongs to me.'</p>

<p>"'Your son?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'Any relation of yours?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'Your slave?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'You bought him?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Where?'</p>

<p>"'Caubul.'</p>

<p>"'When?'</p>

<p>"'Four years ago.'</p>

<p>"'From whom did you buy him?'</p>

<p>"'A merchant.'</p>

<p>"'His name?'</p>

<p>"'Usuf Ooddeen.'</p>

<p>"'What did you give for him?'</p>

<p>"'Three camels.'</p>

<p>"'Of what value?'</p>

<p>"'Thirty rupees (3<i>l</i>.) each.'</p>

<p>"'The boy was cheap, then?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'How so?'</p>

<p>"'He was young and sickly.'</p>

<p>"'Did Usuf say where he got him from?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Then tell me.'</p>

<p>"'From a woman.'</p>

<p>"'What woman?'</p>

<p>"'A native of Hindostan.'</p>

<p>"'An ayah?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Was she his mother?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'Is she living?'</p>

<p>"'No.'</p>

<p>"'When did she die?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Eight years ago.'</p>

<p>"'Where?'</p>

<p>"'In Caubul.'</p>

<p>"'Now tell us all you know about this boy.'</p>

<p>"'I have answered all the Sahib's questions; will
the Sahib answer a few of mine?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Do you believe this boy to be of European birth?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Do you think you know who were his parents?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Were they people of a distinguished family?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.' (This question was answered rather
proudly.)</p>

<p>"'Of pure blood?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'But is the Sahib certain that this boy is the child
of certain parents?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Then will the Sahib take him?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"Here the poor boy placed his hands together and
supplicated the Major to let him remain where he then
was, in the service of the Affghan dealer. Heedless
of this interruption, which was soon silenced, the
examination&mdash;or rather the conversation, as it now
became&mdash;was continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What will you give for him?'</p>

<p>"'What do you ask?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<i>You</i> must speak, Sahib.'</p>

<p>"'One hundred rupees.'</p>

<p>"'He cost me nearly that when he was very young
and sickly.'</p>

<p>"'Well, two hundred rupees.'</p>

<p>"'No; Sahib. Half a lac of rupees would not
purchase him.'</p>

<p>"'But, my good man, slavery is not permitted in
the British dominions, and we will detain the boy.'</p>

<p>"'Against his will?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'On suspicion that he is born of European parents
of distinction?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Then I will give the boy his liberty; and if he
then wishes to follow me, and you detain him, he is
your prisoner instead of my slave.'</p>

<p>"Here the boy again entreated the Major to spare
him.</p>

<p>"'Never mind that.'</p>

<p>"'But suppose that I could prove to you that
he is the child of a sergeant of the Queen's 13th
Regiment of Foot, and of his wife? What then?
Would you take the boy?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'You would?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Then you shall have the boy. Many of your
questions I answered falsely, on purpose. The true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
history of the child I will recount to you, and produce
such proofs as I have in my possession. I
vowed to God and to the Prophet that I would never
sell the child, and I have kept my word. It will be a
bitter grief to me to part with him; but, for his own
sake, I will endure it.</p>

<p>"'Usuf Ooddeen was my elder brother. He kept
a shop in the bazaar at Caubul. This child was
brought to him by a woman of Hindostan, who not
only deposited with him the child, but a sum of
money in gold mohurs and rupees; likewise a quantity
of English jewellery, and her own gold and silver
bangles. She represented to my brother that the
child's parents had been killed, and that she was
afraid every European in Affghanistan would share
their fate. My brother knew the woman, that is to
say, she had been a customer at his shop, and had
purchased from him sundry articles of warm clothing
for her employers and herself. After leaving the
child, and the money, and the jewellery, in all to the
value of about four thousand rupees, she went her
way, and never returned. It is most likely that she
died suddenly of cold, like very many of the native
servants of Hindostan, both male and female. The
frost settled about their hearts, and they slept their
lives away; or, if they escaped death, they lost their
toes, fingers, ears, or noses.</p>

<p>"'When the British army was victorious, and
affairs were in a somewhat settled state, my brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
was most anxious to deliver up the child, the money,
and the jewels, to the British authorities; but a number
of his friends dissuaded him from so doing, on
the ground that the bare possession of the child
would place my brother's life in jeopardy, by inducing
a conclusion that he was the affrighted accomplice of
murderers, assassins, and thieves. I confess that I
was one who entertained this opinion, and I shook
my head whenever my brother repeated his desire.
Four or five years ago, my brother died, and I, a
wandering dealer, became the guardian of this boy
(for whom I have a great affection), and the holder
of his money, for which I care not, and which I have
no desire to retain. He has travelled thousands and
thousands of miles with me. He has been to Bokhara,
to Cashmere, all over the Punjab, to Mooltan, Scinde,
all through the north-west provinces down to Calcutta,
to Simlah, Mussooree&mdash;wherever the English have
settled themselves in India; and I have done all in
my power to expose him, in a quiet way, to the gaze
of ladies and gentlemen, in the hope that some day he
would be recognised and restored to his proper position
in life. Never, until now, has any one been
struck with his countenance, beyond casually remarking
to me that he was a very pretty boy; certainly,
no one ever seemed to have the slightest idea that he
was born of European parents, and is a Christian;
for he is not a Mussulman&mdash;though he thinks he is
a Mussulman, and says his prayers, and is very constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to all the observances of the Mussulman faith.
Gentleman, I am a wandering dealer from Affghanistan,
but I am not destitute of good feeling and integrity,
little as you may credit my assertions in this
respect. Give me a proof that you know who were
the child's parents, and I am willing to restore him,
and all that rightfully belongs to him, to your
custody.'</p>

<p>"'But are you not satisfied with my word? Never
mind the money and the jewels&mdash;much as I should
like to see the latter&mdash;all I require is the boy,' said
the Major.</p>

<p>"'Of course, the Sahib would not speak an untruth
knowingly,' returned the Affghan. 'But I require
some proof that the boy is the child of certain
European parents.'</p>

<p>"'Well, there is the likeness, the unmistakeable
likeness, that he bears to his father and his mother.'</p>

<p>"'That will not do,' said the Affghan, interrupting
the Major. 'Can you write in the Persian character,
Sahib?'</p>

<p>"'Yes.'</p>

<p>"'Then, write the name of this boy's father in the
Persian character, and let me see it.'</p>

<p>"The Major did this, and handed it to the Affghan,
who looked at the writing, smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"'What else? What was the Sahib's nishan
(crest)?'</p>

<p>"'This,' said the Major, holding out the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
finger of his right hand, upon which was a signet-ring.
'This was his nishan. We are of the same family,
and the nishan is the same.'</p>

<p>"The Affghan, having examined the crest, again
smiled, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What else?'</p>

<p>"'What more do you want?' said the Major.</p>

<p>"'Do not be impatient, Sahib,' said the Affghan.
'The identification of a child, who may be an heir to
property, is not so light a matter as the purchase of a
kitten. Did you know the child's mother?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' said the Major. 'She was also a relation
of mine.'</p>

<p>"'What kind of person was she? Was she handsome?'</p>

<p>"'Very.'</p>

<p>"'The colour of her eyes?'</p>

<p>"'Dark&mdash;almost black.'</p>

<p>"'And her hair?'</p>

<p>"'Brown; the colour of this lady's' (pointing to the
wife of my friend).</p>

<p>"'If you saw her likeness, in miniature, do you
think you could recognise it?'</p>

<p>"'If it were a faithful likeness, I could.'</p>

<p>"The Affghan put his hand into the breast pocket
of his chogah, and produced a greasy leathern bag,
into the mouth of which he inserted his finger and
thumb, and presently produced a small tin box,
round and shallow, which he very carefully opened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Having removed some cotton, he handed the box to
the Major. All of us instantly recognised the features
of the unfortunate lady who had perished by the side
of her husband, in Affghanistan. Who could possibly
forget that sweet feminine face of hers, which
had been painted for her husband by one of the most
distinguished miniature painters of the age? The
production of the likeness in the presence of the boy
(who appeared to take little interest in what was
going on), had a sad effect upon the Major. He sat
down upon a chair, covered his manly face with his
hands, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"'And do you know this, Sahib?' asked the
Affghan, when the Major had somewhat recovered
his violent emotion: placing in his hand poor Percy's
seal.</p>

<p>"We all recognised the seal, the crest of which, of
course, corresponded with the crest on the signet-ring
of the Major.</p>

<p>"'And this?' asked the Affghan, holding up a
bracelet which we had seen Mrs. Percy wear many
and many a time.</p>

<p>"'And this?' holding up to our gaze a small
brooch she used to wear constantly. And, amongst
numerous other things, he exhibited to us a little
pocket-book, in which she kept her memoranda, such
as:&mdash;'November 9th. Cut the ends of my dear
little boy's hair. Sent mamma a small portion.&mdash;November
12th. Had a long talk to the old ayah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
who swore to me that she would ... and
I believe her, for she has been a good and constant
creature to us, in our dangers and our difficulties.'</p>

<p>"'And this? And this? And this? And this?'
said the Affghan, withdrawing from the leathern bag
its entire contents, every article of which was instantly
identified. 'There, Sahib, take them all, and the
boy, into your custody. The money, which was left
with him, I will restore to you to-night. It is at
present in the bazaar, in the charge of my camel,
whom no one dare approach, except myself and this
boy.'</p>

<p>"Here a very extraordinary and painful, but perhaps
natural, scene occurred. The boy, who had been
comparatively passive, now broke out into a vehement
expostulation, and spoke with a rapidity which was
truly amazing, considering that he distinctly enunciated
every syllable to which he gave utterance.
'What!' he exclaimed, 'will you then leave me in
the hands and at the mercy of these unbelievers?
What have I done to deserve this?'</p>

<p>"'Be quiet,' said the Affghan to the boy, in a gentle
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"'How can I be quiet?' cried the boy, clenching
his fists convulsively, and drawing himself up, whilst
his eyes glared, and his nostrils dilated, with uncontrollable
passion, and something like foam stood upon
his crimson lips. There could be no doubt whose
child he was, so wonderful in his wrath was the likeness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
that he bore to his father, who was very seldom
provoked to anger, but who, when it did happen, was
'perplexed in the extreme:' in short, a perfect demon
until the paroxysm was over.</p>

<p>"'Baba (child)!' said the Major, 'listen to me.'</p>

<p>"'Don't talk to him now, Sahib,' said the Affghan,
compassionately. 'In his anger his senses always
leave him, and he cannot hear what you say. Let
him exhaust his fury upon me. He will be powerless
presently.'</p>

<p>"And so it was. After a brief while, the boy sat
down on the carpet, gasped for breath, and was seemingly
unable to move or speak. The lady of the
house offered him a glass of water, but he shrunk
back, and declined to receive it from her hand.</p>

<p>"The Affghan took the Major aside, spoke to him
in private, and then left the room. Here another
very painful scene ensued. The boy, exhausted as he
was, attempted to follow his late master; he was restrained,
of course; whereupon he uttered the most
heart-rending cries that ever were heard. The Major
had him conveyed to his bungalow, where a room was
set apart for him, and a servant and an orderly had
him in their keeping. It was a month before the
boy could be reconciled to his 'fate,' as he called it;
and soon afterwards arrangements were made for
sending him home to his grandfather and grandmother,
who are persons of a lofty position in life and
very wealthy. They received him with extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
affection, and on the death of his grandfather, he will
succeed to a title and an estate worth eleven thousand
a-year. The Affghan, who was very fond of the boy,
corresponds with him regularly, and they exchange
presents, as well as letters.</p>

<p>"Kelly, of the 62nd, who was killed at Ferozeshah,
and who formerly belonged to the 13th Foot,
when they were in Affghanistan, told me a more
curious story of a little girl, than the one I have related
to you of this boy."</p>

<p>"What was it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," said the Lieutenant, "I cannot
talk any more just now. You shall have it some
other day. We are not going to part company yet,
old boy." With these words he fell asleep, his feet
over the dashboard, and his head resting on my
shoulder.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2>THE MARCH CONTINUED.</h2>

<p>The next encampment-ground at which we halted
was close to a d√¢k bungalow; and, during the day,
there were several arrivals and departures, the travellers
merely halting for an hour or so, while some
refreshment was got ready. The Lieutenant, who
appeared to know everybody in Hindostan (I never
met a person who did not know him), contrived, to
use his own phrase, to "screw a small chat out of
each of them." On one occasion he returned to the
tent richer than he left it. He carried in one hand a
small basket containing preserved oysters, crystallized
apricots, and captains' biscuits, and in the other a
stone bottle of Maraschino. Under his arm was a
quantity of gauze, which he wanted for a veil, he said.
These contributions he had levied from a lady who
was going to Muttra, where her husband was an
official of some magnitude. She had just returned
from England, the Lieutenant informed me, and was
looking as blooming as possible. To my question,
"Do you know her?" he responded, "Oh yes; she is
one of my sixty!"</p>

<p>"Sixty what?"</p>

<p>"First cousins."</p>

<p>"All in India?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Every one of them. My good sir, I have at this
moment, in the Bengal Presidency alone, upwards of
two hundred and twenty relations and connexions,
male and female, and every one of them&mdash;that is to
say, the men and the boys&mdash;in the service of the
government."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is more, four-fifths of the number
are in the civil service. I should have been in the
civil service too, only I was sent away from Haileybury
for rebellion and card-playing. It is not an
easy matter for me to go to any station in these
provinces without finding a cousin in it."</p>

<p>"Do you know the assistant-magistrate of Agra?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is he a cousin of yours?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> isn't. But his wife's father and my father
were own brothers; so it amounts to pretty much
the same thing."</p>

<p>"And do you know the judge of Jampore?" This
was a gentleman to whom I had letters of introduction.</p>

<p>"Yes. His mother was my aunt."</p>

<p>"It must be dangerous," I suggested, "to express
an opinion of any one in India in the presence of a
man who has so very many relations."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no!" said the Lieutenant. "A man
with such a frightful lot of connexions has no right
to be, and is not generally, very sensitive. Bless me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
if I had nothing to do but to stand up for my relations,
I should run the risk of being perpetually
knocked down. Life is much too short for that sort
of thing. Therefore, when I hear any one abuse or
reflect upon any relation or connexion of mine, I am
invariably silent; or, if appealed to, express my
indifference by a shrug of the shoulders."</p>

<p>Here we were interrupted by the old Soubahdar,
who came to the door of the tent. He had dined,
washed, smoked, slept, and had now got up to
grumble. His huge teak-box, which measured four
feet by two, and two feet deep, and without which
he never travelled, had received a slight injury, and
of this he had come to complain. He said, that in
the time of Lord Clive or Lord Lake, if such a thing
had happened, the men in charge of the hackeries
(carts) would have been hanged on the spot; and
Phool Singh Brahmin, whose exertions, he alleged,
prevented the utter destruction of the box, would
have been promoted to the rank of havildar.</p>

<p>"Clive and Lake!" whispered the Lieutenant to
me. "He talks like a leading article in a London
newspaper." Then, turning to the old man, he inquired,
"Would Lord Clive or Lord Lake have
sanctioned your carrying about that beastly trunk on
a march at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib."</p>

<p>"It is not true. Lord Clive and Lord Lake gained
their victories by the help of self-denying men, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
cheerfully endured any personal inconvenience; not
by a parcel of old grumblers like yourself, who have
no right to refer to the career of those illustrious
men."</p>

<p>"Sahib, I was with Lord Lake's army."</p>

<p>"Then, that's the very reason that you ought not
to be here."</p>

<p>"But our present Colonel, Sahib, was with Lord
Lake."</p>

<p>"And I wish he was with Lord Lake now!"</p>

<p>"I shall report this, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Very well. Do!"</p>

<p>Whereupon the old officer left the tent, and the
Lieutenant assured me that the Colonel, who was as
imbecile as the Soubahdar, would cause the matter
to be investigated, and that he, the Lieutenant,
would, to a certainty, receive a severe reprimand.</p>

<p>"For what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"For not having made arrangements for the safe
conveyance of the baggage, and for having treated with
a want of courtesy a native commissioned officer of the
regiment. I need scarcely say, that this reprimand
will not in any way interfere with my night's rest."</p>

<p>"But, the complainant will forget it," said I, "before
he gets back to the regiment."</p>

<p>"Forget it!" exclaimed the Lieutenant. "Forget
it! A native&mdash;especially a native commissioned
officer&mdash;forget a grievance! Catch that old man
forgetting the slightest unpleasantness that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
occurred to him during this march. He will, it is
true, forget his present grievance to-morrow, when he
has a fresh one; but at the end of the journey they
will be forthcoming in a lump."</p>

<p>This prophecy was destined not to be fulfilled; for,
presently, a Sepoy came to the Lieutenant, and reported
that the Soubahdar was very ill. We hastened
to the old man's tent, and found him, strange to say,
in the last extremity. He was going very fast; but,
nevertheless, he continued to gurgle forth a grievance.
He demanded, with his last breath&mdash;why the East
India Company did not give him his pay, as in Lord
Lake's time, in <i>sicca</i> rupees?</p>

<p>"You shall, in future, receive it in <i>sicca</i> rupees,"
said the Lieutenant, bending over the old man, whose
hand he grasped tightly.</p>

<p>"And will my losses be made good?" he asked,
with awful energy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>"It is well!" and the old man slipped almost imperceptibly
from one world to another.</p>

<p>That the old Soubahdar, who was upwards of
eighty, had died of natural causes, there could be no
question; but, clamorous as was the entire company
for the interment of the body, the Lieutenant determined
on taking it to Agra, for the purpose of a
surgical examination. Meanwhile the old man's
effects were scrupulously collected and put under
seal.</p>

<p>We were now only twenty-six miles from Agra, the
capital of the North West Provinces, and it was
agreed to perform the distance in one march. We
therefore started at sundown, and travelled all
night. The moon was shining brightly, the road was
in excellent order, and, notwithstanding that the old
Soubahdar was lying lifeless on the top of some of
the treasure-boxes, the Sepoys were in high spirits,
and on several occasions even jocular in respect
to the deceased's weakness&mdash;that of perpetually
grumbling.</p>

<p>Shortly after the day had dawned, I beheld on the
distant horizon something like a large white cloud.
Had we been at sea, I should have said it was a sail
or an iceberg, to which it bore a striking resemblance.
I pointed it out to the Lieutenant, who smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't you know what that is?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," I answered.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?"</p>

<p>"No. What is it?"</p>

<p>"That is the famous Taj Mahal. That is the
building that defies the most graphic pen in the world
to do justice to its grandeur and its transcendent
beauty. Bulwer, in the <i>Lady of Lyons</i>, has a passage
which sometimes reminds me of the Taj:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
A palace lifting to eternal summer<br />
Its marble halls from out a glassy bower<br />
Of coolest foliage, musical with birds.<br />
</div>

<p>But how far short must any description of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
place fall! How far distant do you suppose we are
from that building?"</p>

<p>"About two miles."</p>

<p>"Upwards of nine miles, as the crow flies! Yes;
that is the Taj, the tomb of a woman, the wife of the
Emperor Shah Jehan. The pure white marble of
which it is built was brought from Ajmere. For upwards
of twenty-five years, twenty-five thousand men
were employed, day by day, on that edifice. I am
afraid to say how many millions it cost. The Mahrattas
carried away the huge silver gates and made
them into rupees. What became of the inner gate,
which was formed of a single piece of agate, no one
can say. The general opinion is, that it is buried
somewhere in Bhurtpore. The original idea was, to
build a corresponding tomb on this side of the river
for the Emperor himself, and connect the two by a
bridge of white marble. A very pretty idea, was it
not? Lord William Bentinck was for pulling the Taj
down and selling the marble, or using it for building
purposes."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Not at all. He thought it was very impolitic to
allow these gorgeous edifices to stand&mdash;these monuments
of folly, extravagance, and superstition, which
served none but the worst of prejudices, leading the
natives to draw prejudicial comparisons between the
simple and economical structures of the British and
these stupendous and costly erections of the Moghul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Emperors. And most assuredly our bungalows,
churches, and other buildings do present a most
beggarly appearance alongside these masses of polished
marble and red stone. It looks as though we had no
confidence in our hold of the country, and therefore
would not go to any expense worth speaking of.
Look at our court-houses, in the civil lines, as that
part of Agra is called&mdash;a parcel of paltry brick and
mortar pigeon-holes, not to be compared with the
tenements that the menial servants of the Emperors
inhabited. Look at the Government House, the
Metcalfe Testimonial, and other paltry European
edifices.</p>

<p>"Surely," said I, "you would preserve rather than
deface or destroy these magnificent works of art&mdash;these
wonders of the world?"</p>

<p>"Works of art and wonders of the world they
doubtless are; but, under existing circumstances,
they are eye-sores, and I would pull down every one
of them, and convert the material into useful buildings&mdash;barracks&mdash;splendid
barracks for our British and
native troops; hospitals, worthy of being called hospitals;
court-houses, churches, magazines, and so
forth."</p>

<p>"But what barbarians the natives would think
us!"</p>

<p>"What does that signify? Are we the conquerors
of the country, or are we not? As to what they
would think of us, they can't think much worse of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
us than they do already. Do we not eat swine's flesh?
and do not English ladies dance (the natives call it
'jumping about'), and with men who are not their
husbands? Barbarians! Why, the very dress that
we wear renders us barbarians in their sight."</p>

<p>The sun had now risen high in the heavens, and
his rays fell upon the Taj, which we were gradually
approaching. I was wrapped in admiration, and
wishing in my inmost heart that my talkative companion
would cease, and leave me to gaze in silence
on that glorious scene, when suddenly the procession
halted, and the Lieutenant shouted out the word
"Hulloa!" in a voice so loud that I was completely
startled.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Matter!" the Lieutenant echoed me. "Matter!
Look a-head! There is a wheel off one of those
rickety carts, and those confounded boxes are scattered
all over the road." Here the little officer
bounded like an Indian-rubber ball from his seat,
and in a towering passion with all the world in
general, but no one in particular, rushed to the spot
where the disaster had occurred, and there began to
fret, fume, and snort most violently.</p>

<p>"Hush, Sahib!" said one of the Sepoys, saluting
his officer very respectfully, "or you may wake the
Soubahdar, and <i>then</i> what will happen?"</p>

<p>This appeal had the effect of restoring the Lieutenant
to calmness and good-humour. He smiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and seemed to feel that matters would certainly
have been worse, and the delay more protracted,
had the old man been alive and witnessed the
accident.</p>

<p>One of the boxes was smashed to pieces, and the
rupees were lying about in all directions, the Sepoys
picking them up, and searching for others in the
dust and sand. I never witnessed a more ridiculous
or grotesque scene than this&mdash;the native soldiers in
their red coats and chacos, but with bare legs and
without shoes, kneeling, and sifting the earth through
their fingers, the Lieutenant in his pyjamahs and
solar hat, a cheroot in his mouth, and in his hand the
buggy-whip, which he used as a baton while giving
his orders.</p>

<p>"Does this often happen?" I was tempted to ask.</p>

<p>"Constantly," was the Lieutenant's reply. "The
Government has a bullock-train for the conveyance
of stores; and even private individuals, by paying for
the carriage, may have their goods taken from station
to station; but, in respect to treasure, we cling to the
old system. The military authorities apply to the
magistrates, whose subordinates provide these hackeries,
which were in vogue some five thousand years
ago. And just observe those rotten boxes."</p>

<p>"Why are they not lined with cast iron or zinc?"</p>

<p>"It would be too expensive. The Government
cannot afford it."</p>

<p>"But why should not the Government use its own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
bullock-train for the conveyance of treasure, instead of
hiring these antiquated and rotten conveyances?"</p>

<p>"Because the bullock-train is under the post-office
authorities; and the military authorities have nothing
to do with the post-office authorities."</p>

<p>"Is that a reason?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nor is it rhyme; but it is a part of our Indian
system, and, what is more, it is Government logic.
However, I am not going to stop here all day. We
will push on, and get into Agra before breakfast.
The treasure will come all right enough, and I will
be there to meet it at the office of the magistrate and
collector."</p>

<p>We now took our seats in the old buggy. The
hood was raised, the syce sat behind, and off we went
at a canter, which very soon became a gallop. In the
parlance of the Lieutenant, the old horse was indeed "a
ripper." When warm there was no holding him, and
he went over his seven and a half miles of ground in
thirty-seven minutes. At the bridge of boats which
crosses the Jumna, we met, by chance, the assistant
magistrate (the friend with whom I was going to stay,
and the husband of the Lieutenant's first cousin). He
was dressed in a pair of large jack-boots, corduroy
breeches, a shooting-coat, and a solar helmet, and was
riding an immensely powerful Cape horse. He did
not recognise either of us at first, but pulled up, and
turned round the moment the Lieutenant shouted out
his name, with the addition of "Old boy!"&mdash;household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
words in the mouth of the Lieutenant, for he
not only applied them to things animate, but inanimate;
for instance, his corkscrew, his teapot, his
buggy, his watch, his hat, everything with him was
an old boy, in common with the Lieutenant-Governor,
or the general commanding the division.</p>

<p>After I had been greeted by my friend, who had
been at a loss to account for my delay in reaching
Agra&mdash;the Lieutenant thus addressed him:</p>

<p>"I say, old boy. Look here. I have a lot of treasure
for you about seven or eight miles from this; but
there has been a break down. Send out a lot of fellows
to give assistance, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And look here, old boy. There's a dead Soubahdar."</p>

<p>"A what?"</p>

<p>"A dead Soubahdar. He died suddenly, and I
don't wish him to be buried without an examination,
because I bullied him mildly only a short time previous
to his going out. You will manage that for me,
old boy, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"He died of old age, and his last grievance; but
still I should like a medical man's certificate; just to
satisfy the colonel who served with him in Lord
Lake's time, you know, and all that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I can manage all that for you," replied the official,
riding by the side of the buggy; "but push on, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the sun is becoming rather oppressive, and I have no
hood to my saddle, remember."</p>

<p>My host and hostess made me as comfortable and
as happy as any traveller could wish to be made. Of
the former I saw little or nothing from eleven in the
morning till three or four in the evening, for he was
what is called a conscientious officer, and attended
strictly to his work. During these hours I used to
read, or pay a visit to the mess-rooms of a regiment
where a billiard-table was kept. To the officers of
the regiment I was introduced by Lieutenant Sixtie,
previous to his return to his own corps. He stayed
eight days in Agra&mdash;upon some plea or other&mdash;and
sent his company on, in advance of him.</p>

<p>Agra&mdash;that is to say, the society of Agra&mdash;was at
the time split into two sections, the civil and the military.
They were not exactly at open war, but there
was a coolness existing between the two branches.
They did not invite each other, and very seldom
exchanged calls. For me, who was desirous of seeing
all parties, this was rather awkward, living as I was
in the house of a civilian. So I resolved upon taking a
small bungalow for a short period, and furnishing it in
a mild and inexpensive manner. I was candid enough
to confess to my host that, as I was in no way connected
with either branch of the service, I was anxious
to avoid taking any part in their local differences;
and he had the good sense not to press me to remain
under his roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>A few days after I had located myself in my bungalow,
I received a call from a native gentleman, a Seik
chieftain, who was, and now is, a state prisoner on a
handsome stipend. He drove up to my door in a
small phaeton, drawn by a pair of large black mules
of incredible swiftness and agility. This fallen chieftain&mdash;a
tall and powerfully-built man&mdash;was no other
than the renowned Rajah Lall Singh, who commanded
the Seik cavalry at the battle of Ferozeshah, and who
was subsequently Prime Minister at Lahore, during a
portion of the time that the British Government undertook
the administration of the Punjab on behalf
of Maharajah Dulleep Singh. Lall Singh was now
studying surgery. More than one medical officer in
charge of the hospitals which he attended, informed
me that the Rajah was already a comparatively skilful
operator, and could take off an arm or a leg with surprising
dexterity. Notwithstanding his previous
character&mdash;that of a sensualist and faithless intriguer;
one, indeed, who had not been constant
even to his own villanies&mdash;I could not help liking
his conversation, which was humorously enlivened
with imitations of English officers with whom he had
come in contact, and was entertaining to the last degree.
His anecdotes, relating to the late Runjeet
Singh, were peculiarly interesting; coming as they
did from the lips of a man who had been so much in
the company of that remarkable monarch, who in
many respects resembled Napoleon the First, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in the selection of the instruments of his power.
"All his" (Runjeet's) "chief men," said the Rajah,
"were persons of obscure origin: Tej Singh, Sawan
Mull, Deenanauth, and the rest of them."</p>

<p>"But you were an exception," said I.</p>

<p>"Indeed not," was his reply. "I began life as a
muleteer, and hence my partiality for mules, perhaps."</p>

<p>After a while the Rajah invited me to take a drive
with him, to a house about two miles in the country,
and situated on the banks of the Jumna. It was not
his own house, which was then under repair, he said,
but had been placed at his disposal by a friend. I
thanked the Rajah, and stepped into his carriage; he
followed me, seized the reins, shook the whip, and
away we went at the rate of sixteen miles an hour.</p>

<p>The garden-house, at which we soon arrived, was a
spacious building of European architecture. It had
formerly belonged to a general officer who had married
a native woman of considerable wealth. The
furniture was all of European make, and was arranged
very much in the same manner as that in the Sahib
Logue's apartments at Bhitoor. In point of quality
it was also very much the same&mdash;a portion costly, and
the rest of a common description. This house, too,
was constantly inhabited by English folks who sought
a change of air for a few days. Since his removal to
Agra, Lall Singh lived more like an European than a
native, and had got into the habit of sitting at ease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in a chair, instead of cross-legged like a tailor on the
carpet. His dress was of the simplest and most unpretending
character imaginable; and, with the exception
of a signet-ring on his forefinger, he had no
ornament on his person. The table of the apartment
to which he conducted me was literally covered with
surgical instruments&mdash;saws, knives, scalpels of every
size and shape. Amongst them I perceived a pair of
swords in wooden scabbards covered with rich green
velvet, and ornamented with gold and precious stones.
Observing that my eyes rested on these swords, he
took one up, and remarked, "These have performed
some curious operations in their time; but never in
a hospital. They have been used chiefly for taking off
heads. This once belonged to Dhyan Singh, and that
to Heera Singh, who were both assassinated. They are
of Damascus steel, and are sharper than any of these
knives or scalpels. I have sent a number of swords
to England to have them made into surgical instruments."
Here our conversation was interrupted by
a domestic, who announced&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
"<span class="smcap">The Lallah Sahib</span>;"
</div>


<p>and presently a native gentleman walked, or rather
limped (for he was lame of the right leg) into the
room, and made a very graceful salaam, first to the
Rajah and then to myself. He was rather short in
stature, but very stoutly built, and about forty years
of age. His eyes were full of intelligence and vigour,
and his features regular and well-shapen. His manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
were easy, affable, unassuming, and modest, and
his attire as plain and quiet as possible.</p>

<p>"This gentleman, Sahib," said the Rajah, addressing
me, "is a great friend of mine. This house
belongs to him. A strange world is this! Only a
few years ago, I offered a reward of a lac of rupees
(ten thousand pounds) for his head, or two lacs to any
one who would bring him alive to my tent."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and if I had caught him, how changed would
have been the whole face of affairs in this country!"</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"This gentleman was the contractor for the British
army; and, if I had got hold of him, the army could
not have been supplied."</p>

<p>"But why was he worth more alive than dead?" I
asked, with a laugh, in which the native gentleman
heartily joined.</p>

<p>"Because," returned the Rajah, coolly, "if we had
secured him alive we would have made him feed us
with the supplies bought with his own money; which
should also have paid the reward for his capture.
This, by the way, was claimed by several who brought
in heads, alleging that each was the head of the
Lallah the contractor; but the attempted imposition
was discovered, and the perpetrators were themselves
decapitated."</p>

<p>Unlike Hindoos and Mussulmans, who drink in
secret, Lall Singh drank neat brandy openly; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
rising from his chair, he administered unto himself a
couple of glasses&mdash;or rather a tumbler half-filled&mdash;on
this occasion. He could take more than two bottles
of brandy without being in the least intoxicated. This
was owing, of course, to the circumstance that he
consumed considerable quantities of bhang; just in
the same way that an opium-eater is rarely or never
affected by drinking deeply of wine.</p>

<p>The Rajah's visitor, the Lallah Jooteepers√¢d, had
a grievance, and a rather substantial one. He had
claimed from the Government fifty-seven lacs of rupees
(half a million and seventy-thousand pounds sterling)
as the balance due to him for feeding the armies
employed during the two Seik campaigns; and the
Government had threatened to prosecute him, in one
of their own courts, for an attempt to make an overcharge
of forty thousand rupees, or four thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>"And if they understand the principles of good
government thoroughly," said the Rajah, "they will
convict you, imprison you for life, and confiscate all
your possessions, real and personal. That is the way
the Lahore Durbar would have settled so large a
claim. But the Indian Government has not the
courage to act in that way."</p>

<p>"But I have not attempted to make an overcharge;
and if my agents have done so, let it be deducted,
if it be incorrect," said the Lallah.</p>

<p>"You are a criminal," said the Rajah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"How so?" asked the Lallah.</p>

<p>"You say the Government owes you fifty-seven
lacs?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and honestly."</p>

<p>"Well, is not that enough to warrant your being
transported for life, or hanged? But, as I have told
you, the Government has not courage to prosecute
you."</p>

<p>In this opinion, however, Lall Singh was in error;
for, that very night, the Lallah was informed that he
was, to all intents and purposes, a prisoner, and must
not leave Agra. The firm belief of every native, not
only in the district but throughout India, was, that
these proceedings had been taken to evade payment
of the contractor's just demands. But the Lallah
himself was the first to deny this assertion, and to
declare that the prosecution arose out of the circumstance
of the Commissary-General being a near relative
of the Governor-General of India; that a civilian
in power had a quarrel with the Commissary-General,
and had represented, semi-officially, that great frauds
had been committed, and there could be no question
that the heads of the departments were cognisant of
such frauds; that the Governor-General, anxious that
the honour of a member of his ancient family should
be cleared up, had determined upon a strict investigation;
and that the civilian in question suggested the
public prosecution of the contractor as the speediest
and most satisfactory means of arriving at the result!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
And such was the opinion of many officers of the
Government, civil and military!</p>

<p>The contractor, however, was eventually acquitted,
and the Government paid the bill. But, to this day,
the natives of India believe that the object of the
Government was to cheat their creditor; while the
officers, civil and military, are equally sanguine that
it was "the honour of the family" that led to the
most extraordinary and protracted trial that ever was
known in India, and which was emphatically denounced,
by the press and public; of every country in
Europe, as absurd, unjust, and shameful. Nevertheless,
Jooteepers√¢d cannot have harboured any revenge
for the wrongs (involving disgrace and dishonour)
which were heaped upon him; for it is he who has
fed, for several months, the five thousand Christians
during their incarceration in the fortress of Agra;
and, amongst the number of civilians there shut up,
is the gentleman who conducted the prosecution on
the behalf of the Government, and who, in the execution
of his duty, strove very hard indeed for a verdict
of guilty! Without Jooteepers√¢d we could not have
held Agra!</p>

<p>When the sun had gone down, and it was cool
enough to walk abroad, Lall Singh led me into the
extensive gardens which surrounded his temporary
abode. The Lallah had left us, and I was now alone
with the ex-Commander of the Seik Cavalry and the
ex-Prime Minister of Lahore. I felt much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
pleasure in his society than I should have felt had he
been in the plenitude of his power; for he bore his
altered condition with great dignity and cheerfulness,
and discoursed upon all sorts of topics without
any restraint or reserve. He even talked about the
Ranee of Lahore&mdash;with whom his name had been so
frequently coupled&mdash;and with a chivalrous spirit
(whether his assertions were true or not is another
matter) assured me that his intrigues with her had
been confined exclusively to politics. I asked him
where this helpless woman had fled to, after her
miraculous escape from Benares, in the garb of a
man? He replied that he knew not. He was sure
she was not in Nepal&mdash;where the authorities supposed
her to be&mdash;but somewhere in our own provinces.</p>

<p>"Was she a beautiful woman?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No; and never had been," was his reply. "But
she had eyes which could charm like those of a snake,
and a voice sweeter than that of a bird."</p>

<p>"They say she was the Messalina of the East," and
I explained to him what the allusion signified.</p>

<p>"It is not true," he exclaimed vehemently. "She
was a vain and clever woman; but the very opposite
of the character that she has been described. She
was proud of the influence she possessed over men
in making them subservient to her will and her
caprices."</p>

<p>"Had she great power over Runjeet Singh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"None. She was his doll, his plaything, and the
only being who could calm him when he had the
horrors. Nothing more."</p>

<p>"How the horrors?"</p>

<p>"Runjeet Singh began life as a petty chieftain,
with a few hundred followers. He acquired a vast
kingdom, and had the most powerful army that the
East ever saw, or will see. Whilst he went on conquering,
shedding blood, and plundering, he was easy
in his mind; but, when he found that he had got as
much as he could manage, he stopped; and then
came his disquiet. His great fear then was that he
could not retain what he had become possessed of&mdash;and
his chief horror was that the Koh-i-noor would
be carried off&mdash;that diamond which Runjeet Singh
stole, and which the Ranee has worn a thousand
times as a bracelet. That diamond which is now in
the crown of England."</p>

<p>"Where did it come from originally?"</p>

<p>"No one can say that. The history of the Koh-i-noor
has yet to be written. Did you ever see a likeness
of Runjeet Singh?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Then I will show you a very faithful one; a
miniature taken by a famous painter who came from
Delhi, and spent his life in Lahore. The Maharajah
was a diminutive, shrivelled man, frightfully pitted
with the small-pox, which had destroyed one of his
eyes; but with the other he could gaze for an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
without ever winking. He had a shrill and squeaking
voice; but it terrified those who heard it, especially
when he was angry. He did not talk much;
but he was a great listener. Then, shrivelled and
emaciated as he was in his later years, he was possessed
of immense physical strength when roused;
and upon horseback, where skill could be exercised,
few men in his kingdom could have disarmed him."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"He inspired all those who approached him&mdash;whether
European or native&mdash;with respect mingled
with intense fear."</p>

<p>Our conversation was here interrupted by a gardener,
who presented the Rajah and myself respectively
with a nosegay; and who volunteered the
information, that some workmen, in digging the
foundation for a vine trellis had come upon an old
house under the earth, and in it had been found
several gold and silver coins.</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the Rajah.</p>

<p>"There," said the gardener, pointing in the direction.</p>

<p>We hurried to the spot, and found that the workmen
had gone; but sure enough, there were the
walls of an apartment, formed of red stone and white
marble.</p>

<p>"This quarter of Agra," said the Rajah to me,
"was formerly inhabited by persons of the highest
rank. Where we are now standing was, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
once the site of a palace; and these walls are those
of the ty-khana&mdash;a vault beneath the dwelling from
which the light is excluded. In these dark places are
usually perpetrated what you English call 'dark
deeds.'"</p>

<p>I expressed a desire to explore this newly discovered
apartment of former days; but the Rajah
told me it was then too late, as the workmen had
gone; but he promised me that if I would come to
him at daylight on the following morning, he would
have great pleasure in gratifying my curiosity.</p>

<p>On the following morning, having spent a very
dreamy night, I was carried in my palanquin to the
Jatnee Bagh. Such was the name of Jooteepers√¢d's
garden-house, in which Lall Singh then resided.
The Rajah was dressing. I was confronted by a
Seik with an enormous beard, whose hair was a
yard long and tied up in a peculiar knot on the top
of his head, and who politely inquired if I would take
coffee. Ere long the Rajah made his appearance,
and we went together to the newly discovered ty-khana,
which was now guarded, since gold and silver
had been found there. The workmen, some twenty
in number, came and commenced their labour: that
of clearing away the earth in all directions, in order
to get to the bottom of the apartment in the ty-khana.
This was accomplished in about two hours, and we
then stood upon a stone-floor in the centre of a room,
about sixteen feet square. In several of the niches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
were little lamps, such as are burnt upon the tombs
of Moslems, and a hookah and a pair of marble chairs
were found in the subterraneous apartment; of which
the sky was now the roof. Whilst examining the
walls, I observed that, upon one side, there was a
ledge about six feet high from the floor (and carried
up therefrom), and about a foot in width. This ledge,
which was of brick and plaster, resembled a huge
mantelpiece, and was continued from one end of the
apartment to the other. I asked the Rajah the reason
of such a structure in the apartment. He replied
that he did not know, nor could any of the workmen
account for it; one of them, however, took a pickaxe
and dug out a portion, when, to my surprise and
horror, I discovered that in this wall a human being
had been bricked up. The skin was still upon the
bones, which were covered with a costly dress of white
muslin, spangled all over with gold; around the neck
was a string of pearls; on the wrists and ankles were
gold bangles, and on the feet were a pair of slippers,
embroidered all over with silver wire or thread; such
slippers as only Mahommedan women of rank or
wealth can afford to wear. The body resembled a
well-preserved mummy. The features were very distinct,
and were those of a woman whose age could not
at the time of her death have exceeded eighteen or
nineteen years. The head was partially covered with
the white dress. Long black hair was still clinging
to the scalp, and was parted across the forehead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
carried behind the ears. It was the most horrible
and ghastly figure that I ever beheld.</p>

<p>The workmen appeared to take this discovery as a
matter of course; or, rather, to regard it only with
reference to the gold and silver ornaments upon the
skeleton, and it was with great difficulty that I could
prevent them stripping it, forthwith. As for the
Rajah, he simply smiled and coolly remarked: "A
case of jealousy. Her husband was jealous of her,
and thought her guilty, and punished her thus&mdash;bricked
her up alive in this wall, with no room to
move about, only standing room. Perhaps she deserved
it,&mdash;perhaps she was plotting against his life;
perhaps she was innocent: who can say? Hindoos
as well as Mahommedans punish their wives in that
way."</p>

<p>"You mean that they used to do so in former
times, previous to British rule in India. But such a
thing could not occur in our time."</p>

<p>"It does not occur so often as it did; but it does
occur, sometimes, even in these days. How do you
know what happens in the establishment of a wealthy
native? Let us look a little further into the wall.
It strikes me that we shall find some more of them."</p>

<p>Orders were given accordingly to the workmen to
remove with great care the whole of the ledge, in
short, to pull away its entire face. This was done; and
how shall I describe the awful spectacle then presented?
In that wall there were no less than <i>five</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
bodies,&mdash;four besides that already alluded to. One
of the number was a young man, who from his dress
and the jewels on his finger-bones must have been a
person of high rank; perhaps the lover of one, or
both, of the young women; for he had been bricked
up between two of them. The others were evidently
those of confidential servants; old women, for they
had grey hair. They possibly had been cognisant, or
were supposed to be cognisant, of whatever offence the
others had been deemed guilty.</p>

<p>The sun was now shining brightly on these ghastly
remains, covered with garments embroidered in gold
and silver. The air had a speedy effect on them,
and, one by one, they fell; each forming a heap of
bones, hair, shrivelled skin, dust, jewels, and finery.
The latter were now gathered up, placed in a small
basket, and sent to Lallah. Their value, possibly,
was upwards of a thousand pounds. How many
years had passed since that horrible sentence had
been put into execution? Not less than one hundred
and seventy, or perhaps two hundred.</p>

<h2>INDIAN SOCIETY.</h2>


<p>Whilst I was at Agra, a distinguished military officer
of high rank, who had just been appointed as a member
of the Council, passed through the station on his
way to the seat of government, Calcutta. It was
supposed that this general officer would, on the
first vacancy, become Deputy-Governor of Bengal;
and of course the society of Agra was resolved to do
him honour. It would not do for anybody to hang
back on an occasion like this; and, for the nonce,
both the civilians and the military were of one mind,
and actually met on an amicable and pleasant footing,
to talk the matter over, and to decide upon what was
to be done. After a friendly debate, which lasted for
four hours, it was resolved that Sir Gunter and Lady
Gallopaway should be invited to a ball and supper,
and not to a dinner. It was further determined that
the entertainment should take place, not at Government-house
(that would be too Civil)&mdash;not at any
mess-room (that would be too Military)&mdash;but at a
good-sized hall called the Metcalfe Institution, this
being perfectly neutral ground. My friend, the civilian
with whom I had been staying, had a perfect contempt
for these local squabbles&mdash;although he was really compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to take a part therein; and, after the meeting
was over, he sat down and wrote a metrical squib,
ridiculing the whole affair, and sent it for publication
to one of the newspapers, the <i>Delhi Gazette</i>. For
this squib&mdash;seeing that it sneered at both the civilians
and the military&mdash;I unfortunately got the credit, and
the consequence was, that, when I made my appearance
at the ball, several of the heads of the society
who had formerly received me with extreme cordiality,
answered me only in monosyllables when I addressed
them. Indeed, I learnt afterwards, from my friend's
wife, that a meeting had actually been called to consider
the propriety of not inviting me, and that I had
very narrowly escaped that punishment; for had it
not been for the vote of her husband my name would
have been omitted, as there were ten for and ten
against me, when he held up his hand in my favour.</p>

<p>But to the ball. There were present some twenty
civilians, all dressed in black with white cravats; and
each had brought with him his wife, or a sister, or
daughter. Of military men (all in full dress uniform)
there were about forty-five or fifty; and the ladies
who came with them may have numbered thirty. In
all, say that there were present&mdash;including visitors
and stragglers like myself&mdash;one hundred and forty.
I was rather late, and, on entering the room, beheld
one of the oddest sights that I ever witnessed: all the
black coats were huddled together, and so were all the
reds. They had been unanimous only so far as giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the entertainment was concerned; and it seemed to
be distinctly understood by each party that there
was to be no mixing; and so the civilians formed
quadrilles and danced with the civil ladies, and the
soldiers with the military ladies. Had there been a
royal regiment in Agra, there would have been three
parties, owing to the jealousy that existed formerly
between the Queen's and the Company's officers. Besides
myself, there were two "interlopers in the East"
present at that ball. The one, a French gentleman;
the other, a German Baron. They, too, were travelling
about in search of the picturesque, and here they
had it with a vengeance. The Frenchman could not
comprehend this exclusiveness on the part of the
blacks; but the German assured us that to him it
was a very common sight, and to be witnessed at
every ball in every garrison town in his country.
"But there," said he, "the military look down on the
civilians, while here, it seems to me, that the civilians
look down on the military. See, see! See how disdainfully
that old Mrs. Revenue Board scrutinizes the
dress of Mrs. Lieutenant-Colonel Damz√®!"</p>

<p>Sure enough such was the case. "But regard!"
said the Frenchman; "how angry is that Mrs. Sudder
Adawlut, because that little Mrs. Infantry (whose
husband, I am told, is the younger son of a poor
English lord) is contemplating her <i>nez en l'air</i>.
Truly this is a magnificent spectacle! Is it always
so, I wonder?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>I was enabled, from experience, to inform him, that
in almost every large station&mdash;and at Agra especially&mdash;it
universally occurs; but that in small stations
seldom or never.</p>

<p>Here we were approached by Lieutenant-Colonel
Damz√® himself. After exchanging a few words with
the foreign gentlemen on either side of me, he passed
on, seemingly proud and happy at having had an opportunity
of slighting me in public, on account of the
doggerel for which I had the credit.</p>

<p>"Mais, monsieur," said the Frenchman to me,
"who, in wonder's name, are all these Damz√® gentlemen?
There is one Damz√®, colonel of such a regiment;
another Damz√®, major in another corps. There
is a Deputy Commissary-General Damz√®; there is a
Mr. Damz√® in the Indian navy; another Damz√® is a
military secretary; some half dozen Damz√®s are, I
have perceived, on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief.
Parbleu! C'est Damz√®&mdash;toujours Damz√®! for
here, by Heaven, I meet with still another Damz√®!
Who <i>are</i> all these Damz√®s?"</p>

<p>I informed him that Damz√® was the patronymic of
a nobleman in power; and with this explanation he
was thoroughly enlightened, and appeared to be perfectly
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Let us move up towards the General," said the
German Baron, who had been introduced to the old
hero. "Let us go and say a few words to him."</p>

<p>It was not easy to do this; hemmed in as was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
General by those who desired to make him remember
them in the future. However, it was managed at
last; and, somehow or other, we three interlopers contrived
before long to monopolize his attention&mdash;we
the only people in the room to whom he could not be
of any service&mdash;for there was nothing that he could
give, or get for us, if we had wanted his patronage.
We, rather maliciously&mdash;so far as the crowd was concerned&mdash;stood
about the distinguished old man and
guarded him; and I have reason to know that he was
grateful to us for so doing. Towards the hour of
twelve, however, we had to stand back; for Mrs. Lieutenant-Colonel
Damz√® came and sat upon the sofa on
the left side of the General, and talked to him in an
animated but somewhat anxious manner, which became
even more anxious when Mrs. Revenue Board
approached, and taking a seat on the General's right
(eyeing Mrs. Lieutenant-Colonel Damz√® with a somewhat
haughty expression), congratulated the General
on his recent good fortune. At this advanced stage
of the evening also, Lady Gallopaway was flanked
right and left by old Mr. Revenue Board and Lieutenant-Colonel
Damz√®, C.B. The reader is requested
to note that these two letters&mdash;C.B.&mdash;were Damz√®'s
by right; or, at all events, that he had been recommended
for the order, and that the recommendation
had been instantly attended to; albeit Damz√® had
never been within range of an enemy's cannon
in the whole course of his life. Lady Gallopaway
yawned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>At length a gong sounded, and the band struck
up that usual signal that supper is ready, "O, the
Roast Beef of Old England, O, the Old English Roast
Beef."</p>

<p>The anxiety of the ladies who sat on either side of
the General was now at it height. They fanned
themselves with fearful vigour; and we, the three interlopers,
fancied that we could hear the palpitation
of their hearts. Meanwhile their husbands, respectively,
by their looks, evinced a corresponding anxiety.
Each stood ready to offer his arm to Lady Gallopaway
as soon as the General had made his election&mdash;of the
lady he would lead to the supper table. Each party
was equally confident but equally nervous, like the
parties to a lawsuit. For weeks past this question
of precedence had been debated in Agra, and very
warmly debated&mdash;namely, whether Mrs. Revenue
Board, of the Civil Service, or Mrs. Lieutenant-Colonel
Damz√®, C.B., was entitled to the <i>pas</i>. Now
was the moment for a decision, or at all events an
authority in support of either position or argument.
The old General (upon whom both Mr. Revenue Board
and Lieutenant-Colonel Damz√®, C.B., had their anxious
eyes) rose, smiled, bowed to the ladies who had flanked
him, left them, and wandered about the ball-room,
looking to the right and left, as if searching for some
one. Presently he stopped short before little Mrs.
Infantry, who was talking to a cornet of the 17th
Light Cavalry. The General offered her his arm.
She took it very graciously, and was led away. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
before leaving the room she halted, turned round, and
stared very significantly at the two elderly ladies who
were still seated on the sofa, overwhelmed in surprise,
horror, and indignation. Infantry, who was only a
lieutenant in his regiment, observing that the General
had recognised the social right of his wife, which she
had derived solely from him, instantly rushed up to
Lady Gallopaway, and offered her an arm (which she
took), led her away in triumph, leaving his own Colonel
(Damz√®) and old Mr. Revenue Board gasping and
gaping at each other in mutual disgust and consternation.
Had a shell burst in the building, had the
powder magazine exploded and shattered all the windows,
the commotion could scarcely have been greater
than it was at that moment. No one could account
for this extraordinary conduct, or caprice, as it was
termed, on the part of the old General. Damz√®, who
had just been flattering him concerning his wonderful
achievements, now declared that "the old fool had
become half-witted since eighteen hundred and forty-seven,"
while Revenue Board, who a quarter of an
hour previously had, to the General's face, held forth
on the unflinching independence which had marked
his character through life, now protested&mdash;openly protested&mdash;that
he had been a time-server throughout
his entire career, and had some object in thus truckling
before the son of an influential peer! The
ladies on the sofa stared at each other; now commiseratingly
and in silence for at least two minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
then simultaneously ejaculated: "What <i>can</i> it
mean!"</p>

<p>"I thought it would have been me," said Mrs. Revenue
Board.</p>

<p>"You?" said Mrs. Damz√®.</p>

<p>"Yes; why not? My husband is a civilian of
twenty years' standing."</p>

<p>"Is not my husband a Lieutenant-Colonel and a
C.B.? If he were only a Major and a C.B. he would
take precedence of Mr. Revenue Board."</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken."</p>

<p>"Indeed not. Do you suppose a C.B. goes for
nothing?"</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Lieutenant-Colonel Damz√® and Mr. Revenue
Board, who had been discussing the same question,
but in a calmer spirit than their wives, approached,
and, making common cause against the upstart enemy
(Infantry and his wife), formed a quartette and went
into the supper room; where, to their intense mortification,
they heard little Mrs. Infantry talking loudly,
on purpose to attract the notice of all present. What
was even more mortifying still, the old General was
paying her marked attention.</p>

<p>The red party, that is to say, the military, were in
very high spirits; the black, the civilians, correspondingly
depressed. The quartette, consisting of Damz√®
and Revenue Board, and their wives, ate voraciously,
but evidently without appetite. They sipped their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
wine with an absent formality, which was very entertaining
to lookers-on, who were in no way interested
in the momentous question which was preying on their
very souls.</p>

<p>"It shall not end here," said Damz√®, moodily fixing
his eyes on the chandelier.</p>

<p>"Not, indeed!" said Mr. Revenue Board.</p>

<p>"I shall put my case to the Governor-General direct,"
said Damz√®. "His Lordship is a near connexion
of mine."</p>

<p>"I am perfectly aware of that," said Mr. Revenue
Board; "but it is my intention to submit my case to
his Lordship through Mr. Bommerson, the Lieutenant-Governor
of these provinces, officially; and, if
his Lordship's opinion should be adverse, I shall have
my appeal to the Court of Directors, amongst whom,
thank Heaven! I have several relations and warm
friends."</p>

<p>"And you will write, I hope, my dear," said Mrs.
Revenue Board, "to Sir John Bobgrouse, who is the
President of the Board of Control, and whose secretary
married your first cousin&mdash;recollect!"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> can write, too," said Mrs. Lieutenant-Colonel
Damz√®.</p>

<p>"You may write to anybody you please," said
Mrs. Revenue Board, defiantly and contemptuously;
"but you will remember that the point between us
is this&mdash;that even if your husband, in consequence of
having got, no matter how, a C.B.ship, has the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to precede my husband, a civilian of twenty years'
standing&mdash;whether you have the right to precede me?
That is the question; and I hope, Revenue dear, you
will not fail to raise it."</p>

<p>Reader, the question was submitted in all its
bearings for the consideration of the Most Noble the
Governor-General of India, who, declining to take
upon himself so fearful a responsibility, referred the
matter to the Home Government. Leadenhall-street
had something to say to it, and so had the Board of
Control. While the case was pending, the newspapers
in every part of India literally teemed with
letters on the subject, and their editors were invited
to give their opinions thereon. Only one of the
number was weak enough to do this, and bitterly did
he repent of his rashness; for, having decided in
favour of the C.B. and of Mrs. C.B., he lost (so he
confessed to me) no less than six-and-twenty civilians
(each of twenty years' standing) in his subscription-list.
For more than eighteen months this precedence
question formed a leading topic, not only in the public
prints, but in private circles. It became, in short, a
perfect nuisance. At length the decision of the Home
Government came out to India; but, alas! they had
only half done their work. They had given C.B.
the precedence over the civilian of twenty years'
standing, but had been silent about their wives! So,
the matter was "referred back." A clerk in the Private
Secretary's office told me that he was occupied for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
three hours in copying only the Governor-General's
minute on the Court's despatch, which was a very
lengthy one, and signed by the chairman for himself
and the other directors, whose names were given in
full. He further informed me that the whole of the
documents connected with this weighty affair would,
if put into type, form a volume five times as bulky as
Sir William Napier's <i>Conquest of Scinde</i>!</p>

<p>How the matter was settled eventually I do not
know; for, when I left India, the question had not
been decided. On the great point, when it was referred
for a second time to the Home Authorities,
there was a difference of opinion between the Court
of Directors and the Board of Control, and a long
correspondence ensued on the subject, between each
of these departments of the Indian Government and
the Governor-General, who was required to have the
case laid before the Advocates-General of the Supreme
Courts at the various Presidencies. These gentlemen
differed one with the other in their views of the case,
each alleging that the point lay in a nutshell, and
was as clear as possible. For all I know to the contrary,
it may be in the nutshell at this moment.
Both Lieutenant-Colonel Damz√® and Mr. Revenue
Board laid "cases" before the Calcutta barristers, who
pocketed their fees, and laconically expressed their
opinions respectively, that the parties who consulted
them were in the right&mdash;"there could be no doubt
on the point," they said. Damz√® sent a copy of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
case, and the opinion of his barrister thereon, to
Revenue Board, who rather triumphantly returned
the compliment. I regret to say, that this contest
engendered in Agra a great deal of what is called bad
blood, and induced many ladies to descend to very
unseemly personalities. For instance, Mrs. Damz√®
one evening, at the band-stand, told Mrs. Revenue
Board, that when she (Mrs. R. B.) returned to
England, she would have no rank at all, as her
husband was not an esquire even&mdash;but a "mister" in
his own country. To which Mrs. Revenue Board
replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And you, pray? Is not your husband in the
Company's service?"</p>

<p>"Yes," rejoined Mrs. Damz√®; "but you forget
the C.B.!"</p>

<p>Let us now return to the Honourable Lieutenant
Infantry. When that officer came up, and led away
Lady Gallopaway to supper, Damz√® was overheard to
say, "I'll take the shine out of that young gentleman."
And, if taking the shine meant constantly
bullying the subaltern, Damz√® certainly kept his
word. And when the next hot weather came, and
the Lieutenant wished to accompany his sick wife to
the Hills, Damz√®, when he forwarded the application
for six months' leave of absence, wrote privately to
the Assistant Adjutant-General, and recommended
that it should not be granted. The honourable
subaltern, however, was rather too strong for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
colonel, in the way of interest. Presuming on the
acquaintance which existed between his father and the
Commander-in-Chief, he wrote a letter to that functionary,
and a few days afterwards found himself in
general orders. The wrath of Damz√® may be easily
imagined, especially as he had boasted to several of
his officers of having put a spoke in the Lieutenant's
wheel. And by way of throwing salt upon the Colonel's
wounds, the Lieutenant called upon him, and, in the
politest manner possible, inquired if there was anything
he could do for him at head-quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While at Agra, a Bengalee Baboo called upon me.
Judging from his appearance, I should have guessed
his age to be about fifty years; but he was upwards
of seventy. He spoke English with marvellous
fluency and accuracy, and could read and write the
language as well and as elegantly as any educated
European. He was, perhaps, the cleverest Hindoo
whom I encountered during my sojourn in the East.
His manners were peculiarly courteous and winning,
and there was an air of penitence about the man,
which, apart from his abilities, induced me to treat
him with kindness and consideration. His name was&mdash;let
us say&mdash;Nobinkissen.</p>

<p>The history of Nobinkissen was simply this. He
was a Brahmin of the highest caste, and, at the age
of eighteen, was a writer in the service of the government,
on a salary of ten rupees per month. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ingratiated himself with every civilian under whom
he served, and gradually rose, step by step, until he
became the Sheristadar, or head clerk, of a circuit-judge
of a court of appeal. In this office he acquired
riches, and was still adding to his store, when his
official career was brought prematurely to a close.</p>

<p>I must here inform the reader that not one civilian
in a hundred, no matter what his rank or grade, can
read and write Hindostanee or Persian, although the
majority of them have some colloquial knowledge of
both those languages. Yet, as a matter of course,
they append their signatures to every document of
which, on hearing it read aloud to them by their
native officials, they approve. Their orders they
dictate orally; those orders are transcribed by the
Sheristadar, who gives them to a native writer to copy.
This done, they are read aloud for correction or
approval, and then signed in English by the covenanted
civilian. Before leaving office every day, such
civilian may have to sign fifty, sixty, or a hundred
documents; for the rule is, not to sign each of them
when read, but to sign them in a mass at the breaking-up
of the court. Here Nobinkissen invented his
means of money making. Whenever the judge gave
a decree in any case of importance, he made a counterpart
of such decree, and when the signing time
came, obtained, without any sort of trouble or inquiry,
the signature of the Sahib and the seal of the Court
to both documents. He was thus, to all intents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
purposes&mdash;or, at all events, for his own&mdash;in possession
of something tantamount to the fee-simple of the
lands in dispute. He could arm either the appellant
or the respondent with the final decree of the Court,
under the hand and official seal of the judge. The
only question with him now was, which of the litigants
would give the most money, and to each, in private,
and in the Sahib's name, he exhibited the documents.
The highest bidder, of course, gained the day, whereupon
Nobinkissen took the coin, handed over one of
the decrees, and burnt the other.</p>

<p>It fell out that Nobinkissen was attacked with
fever, and, in a state bordering on delirium, he parted
with, that is to say, sold, to both respondent and
appellant, a decree, under the hand and seal of the
judge, such decree arming the holder with the power
to take possession of a very large estate in Bengal.
Each party, fearful of a disturbance, which often
occurs when possession of an estate is sought for,
applied to the magistrate of a district, under a certain
regulation of government, for assistance, in order to
enable him to carry out the judge's decree, which
each, as a matter of course, produced. The magistrate
was naturally much perplexed, and made a
reference to the judge, who could only say he had
signed but one decree. There was then a report
made to the government by the magistrate. An investigation
ensued, and the judge was, meanwhile,
suspended, for great suspicion lurked in the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
many that he was not so innocent as he affected to
be. When Nobinkissen recovered from his sickness,
and saw the dilemma in which his superior, the judge,
was placed, he made a clean breast of it, and confessed
that the guilt was his, and his alone. Nobinkissen
was tried, convicted, and sentenced to be
imprisoned in irons for the term of his natural life.
For nine years he was in the gaol at Alipore, near
Calcutta. At the expiration of that period he was
called upon to furnish some information of which he
was possessed, in relation to certain public affairs.
He was brought from the prison, confronted with
several officials, amongst whom was a member of the
council. His altered appearance, his emaciated form,
his attitude of despair, and the intelligence and
readiness with which he responded to the questions
put to him, touched the hearts of those by whom he
was examined, and the member of council, who has
been since a director of the East India Company,
spoke to the Governor-General, and eventually obtained
Nobinkissen's pardon and release. The Hindoos
and Mussulmans in India (like the Arabs) do
not regard being guilty of a fraud or theft as a
disgrace. The degrading part of the business is,
being convicted, and Nobinkissen, on being set at
liberty, could not face his countrymen in Bengal, and
therefore retired to the Upper Provinces, where he
lived in comparative obscurity, and in easy circumstances,
for he had not disgorged his ill-gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
gains. His wife had taken care of them during his
captivity.</p>

<p>At the time that Nobinkissen called upon me, the
government of India were in considerable difficulty in
respect to finance. A new loan had been opened,
but it did not fill, and the government had very
wisely determined upon closing it. Nobinkissen
made this a topic of conversation, and his views&mdash;albeit
they came from a man who had been convicted
of a fraud&mdash;are, at the present time especially, entitled
to the very gravest consideration.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir!" he remarked, "it is a pitiful thing
that the government of a great empire like this
should ever be in pecuniary difficulties and put
to their wits' end for a few millions annually, in
order to make the receipts square with the expenditure."</p>

<p>"But how can it be helped?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Easily, sir," he replied. "Why not make it expedient
to do away with the perpetual settlement of
Lord Cornwallis, and resettle the whole of Bengal?
That is by far the most fertile province in the East;
but it is taxed lighter than even these poor lands of
the Upper Provinces. Look at the Durbungah Rajah.
Nearly the whole of Tirhoot, the garden of India,
belongs to him, and he does not pay into the government
treasury half a lac (five thousand pounds) per
annum, while his collections amount to upwards
of twenty lacs. These are the men who get hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
of the money and bury it, and keep it from circulating."</p>

<p>"But all zemindarees (lands) are not so profitable
in Bengal?"</p>

<p>"No; many are not worth holding&mdash;especially
the smaller ones, although the land is just as good,
and just as well cultivated."</p>

<p>"But how is that?"</p>

<p>"They are so heavily taxed. You must know,
sir, that in those days&mdash;the days of Lord Cornwallis&mdash;the
greatest frauds were committed, in respect to the
perpetual settlement. The natives who were about,
and under, the settlement officers all made immense
fortunes, and the zemindars from whom they took
their bribes, have profited ever since to the cost of
the poorer zemindars, who could not or would not
bribe, and to the cost of the British government. It
is a great mistake to suppose that the whole of the
landholders in Bengal would cry out against a resettlement
of that province. Only men holding vast
tracts of country, at a comparatively nominal rent,
would cry out."</p>

<p>"And tax the British government with a breach
of faith?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But what need the government care for
that cry, especially when its act is not only expedient,
but would be just withal? In Bengal, all
the great zemindars are rich, very rich men. In these
provinces, with very, very few exceptions, they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
poor, so that the whole of Upper India would be glad
to see the perpetual settlement done away with, and
the land resettled."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"That is only human&mdash;and, certainly, Asiatic&mdash;nature.
Few of us like to behold our neighbours
better off than ourselves; so that the cry of faith-breaking
would not meet with a response in this part
of the world."</p>

<p>"Yes; but in Europe the cry would be too powerful
to contend against. The Exeter Hall orators and
the spouters at the Court of Proprietors would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! India should either be governed in India
or in England. It is the number of wheels in the
government that clogs the movement of the machine."</p>

<p>"Very true."</p>

<p>"But who are these men&mdash;these zemindars with
whom you are required to keep an implicit faith? Are
they your friends? If so, why do they never come
forward to assist you in your difficulties? Did a
single zemindar, when, after the battle of Ferozeshah,
the empire was shaking in the balance, lift a finger to
help the government of India? And, to-morrow, if
your rule were at stake, and dependent on their assistance,
think you they would render it? Think you
they would furnish money if your treasury was
exhausted? Not one pice! Think you they would
furnish men to protect your stations denuded of
troops? No! Although hundreds of them can each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
turn out a thousand or two of followers, armed with
iron-bound bludgeons, swords, and shields, when they
desire to intimidate an European indigo-planter, or
to fight a battle between themselves about a boundary
question. These are the men who, in your greatest
need, would remain neutral until, if it so happened,
you were brought to your last gasp, when, as one
man, they would not fail to rise and give you the
final blow."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that? I do not."</p>

<p>"Sir, I know my own countrymen better than you
do."</p>

<p>"If such a state of affairs were to come about, and
these zemindars remained neutral, of course the cry
of breaking faith would be absurd in the extreme.
Neutrality, in such a case, would be almost as bad as
hostility."</p>

<p>[Nobinkissen's prophecy has been fulfilled to the
letter. Our rule has been at stake, in imminent
peril, and not one of these men has offered to assist us
with men or money. The Rajahs of Durbungah and
Burdwan alone, to say nothing of the Newab of Moorshedabad,
between them could have furnished an
army of, at the very least, five thousand stalwart
fighting-men, whereas they have looked upon our
difficulties in perfect apathy. It is from the coffers
of men of this stamp that large sums should be
extracted annually towards keeping up a vast&mdash;an
overwhelming&mdash;European force in India. Faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
with such men as these! What claim have they to
our faintest consideration! What right to expect
that we shall any longer forego the collection of
several extra millions annually&mdash;several extra millions
which, to every intent and purpose, is our just
due?]</p>

<p>"There is a line in Shakespeare, sir," Nobinkissen
continued, "which the government of India should
adopt as its motto, and act up to consistently&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'C√¶sar never does wrong without just cause.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Our conversation was here interrupted by a noise
in the road. I went to the window, and observing a
great crowd, inquired of one of my servants who was
standing in the verandah:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"A bullock has fallen down, and they are trying to
get him up&mdash;that is all, Sahib," was the reply.</p>

<p>I rushed to the spot, followed by Nobinkissen, and
there beheld a scene which in no other country would
have been tolerated by the crowd assembled.</p>

<p>One of a pair of bullocks, drawing an over-laden
cart, had from weakness and fatigue, sank beneath
the burden. The driver of the animals (a Hindoo)
had broken, by twisting it violently, the tail of the
poor beast, which was nothing but skin and bone, and
was covered with wounds from ill-treatment. Heavy
blows and the tail breaking having failed to make
the jaded ox stand upon his legs, the driver&mdash;heedless
of my remonstrance&mdash;collected some straw and sticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and lighted a fire all round him. The poor beast
now struggled very hard, but was unable to rise,
and presently he resigned himself to be scorched to
death.</p>

<p>"I always thought that the cow was a sacred
animal with Hindoos?" said I to Nobinkissen.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he.</p>

<p>"And here is a Hindoo who works one of his gods
till he drops down with sheer fatigue, and then cruelly
puts him to death!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that often happens," said Nobinkissen,
smiling.</p>

<p>"Then, what an absurdity and inconsistency for
the Hindoos at Benares, and other holy places, to
make such a noise if an European only strikes a
sacred animal with a whip! Why, it was only the
other day that a mob collected around the house of
the magistrate and set the authorities at defiance: all
because the magistrate had ordered that one of the
bulls which crowd the streets should be shut up, on
the ground that he had gored several people."</p>

<p>"That is the doing of the Brahmins, who incite the
people to such acts; and every concession on the part
of the government leads those Brahmins to believe
that they have great power, and leads the people also
to believe it. If a Mahommedan finds one of those
bulls in the way, and gives him a thrashing with a thick
stick, or probes him in the side with a sword, the
Brahmins say nothing, nor do the people of Benares."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why is that?"</p>

<p>"Because it would not be worth while. The strife
would be profitless; for, you see, sir, the Mahommedans
are not the rulers of this country, but the Sahibs
are; and hence the jealousy with which they are
watched. In time, the Government of India will see
the necessity of forbidding Hindoo festivals in the
public streets&mdash;abolishing them&mdash;just as Suttee was
abolished. It is only the dissolute rich and the
rabble who take any delight in these festivals, many
of which are indecent and disgusting. Sensible and
respectable Hindoos take no part in them; on the
contrary, they avoid them, and think them a nuisance.
Hindooism will never become extinct, so long as this
world lasts; but the British Government has the
power of doing away with those obnoxious observances
in the public thoroughfares, which only disfigure
the religion."</p>

<p>"Well, in that case, you would have to do away
with the Mahommedan festivals?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly&mdash;in the public streets. In private,
the Mahommedans as well as the Hindoos might be
permitted to keep their festivals in whatever way they
thought proper. Do you suppose that the Mahommedans,
when in power, suffered the Hindoos to
block up the streets continually with their processions,
as they do now? Think you that they entertained
the same consideration for the bulls and the
monkeys at Benares as the British now entertain?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
And when, in turn, the Mahrattas overran this part
of the country, think you that Agra was ever deafened,
as it now is, with the din of the Buckree Ede and
the Mohurrum?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But then you see, Nobinkissen, we
are a tolerant people, and wish to convince both creeds
that we have no desire to interfere with their religious
prejudices in any way whatsoever."</p>

<p>"Yes; but then you are inconsistent, and the consequence
is, that you not only get the credit of being
insincere, but are imposed upon to the utmost."</p>

<p>"How, inconsistent!"</p>

<p>"Why, you declare that you have no desire to interfere
with the religious prejudices of the Hindoo
and the Mahommedan; but you, nevertheless,
encourage missionary gentlemen to go from station to
station to preach in the open air concerning the
superiority of your religion over all others. Believe
me, sir, this does a great deal of harm."</p>

<p>"Ah! but we make converts!"</p>

<p>"How many do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say."</p>

<p>"I can. Take India from one end to the other, and
you make, annually, one out of fifty thousand."</p>

<p>"No more?"</p>

<p>"No more, sir! That is the result of preaching
in the open air, all over the country, and the distribution
of thousands and hundreds of thousands of tracts
printed in the Hindostanee and Bengalee languages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that is something, Nobinkissen."</p>

<p>"And of what class of people are your converts?"</p>

<p>"Respectable men of all classes, I suppose."</p>

<p>"The dregs of both Hindoos and Mussulmans. The
most debased and degraded of Indians&mdash;men who
only assume Christianity in the hope of temporal
advantage and preferment&mdash;and who fling aside their
newly put-on faith, and laugh and scoff at your
credulity the moment they find their hope frustrated.
I could give you at least one hundred instances; but
one will suffice. Not long ago a Mussulman, named
Ally Khan, was converted by Mr. Jones, a missionary
in Calcutta, and, shortly after his conversion, obtained
an appointment with a salary of one hundred rupees
a month, in the Baptist Missionary Society. Here
he contrived to embezzle sixteen hundred rupees, for
which offence he was indicted in the Supreme Court,
found guilty, and sentenced to a year's imprisonment
in the Calcutta gaol. On hearing the sentence he exclaimed:
'In the name of the devil, is this the reward
of renouncing my religion? Farewell, Christianity!
From this hour I am a Moslem again!'</p>

<p>"Another very flagrant case occurred in this very
station. A civilian took into his service a recently
converted Hindoo, as a sirdar-bearer. The fellow had
charge of a money-bag, and ran off with it. And
where and how do you suppose he was apprehended?
At Hurdwar, taking an active part in the Hoolee
Festival! The Roman Catholic priests have long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
since left off asking the natives of India to become
Christians. Those who voluntarily present themselves,
are, after a strict examination, and a due
warning that they must hope for no temporal advantage,
admitted into the Church."</p>

<p>"And do they have any applications?"</p>

<p>"Very very few, indeed; but those whom they
admit do, really and truly, become Christians."</p>

<p>These last words of Nobinkissen were scarcely pronounced,
when a palkee was brought up to my door,
and out of it stepped a Roman Catholic priest&mdash;an
Italian gentleman, a Jesuit&mdash;whom I had met a few
evenings previously at the house of a mutual friend.
Nobinkissen, who appeared to know the reverend
father intimately, related to him the substance of the
conversation we had just held, or rather the latter
part thereof, and the priest corroborated every allegation
that Nobinkissen had made.</p>

<p>"Yea," he added, "we now devote our attention,
exclusively, to the spiritual wants of the white man
who requires our aid&mdash;convinced, as we are, of the
hopelessness of the task of converting the Hindoo and
the Mussulman to Christianity." And, in addition to
the instances of false converts afforded by Nobinkissen,
he did not scruple to detail several others of
an equally atrocious character and complexion.</p>

<h2>THE UPPER PROVINCES.</h2>


<p>Having seen Agra, its edifices, ruins, society,
European and native, and having visited Secundra,
Futteypore, Sickri, and Muttra, I journeyed upwards
to Delhi, where I was received by Mr. Joseph Skinner,
the eldest son of the late Colonel Skinner, renowned
as the founder and commandant of the famous
Skinner's Horse. Mr. Joseph Skinner's house was, at
all times, open to all travellers. He was without exception
the most hospitable man that I ever met in any
part of the world. At his board were to be met daily,
either at luncheon or at dinner, civilians and military
men of every rank and grade in the service, as well
as native gentlemen of position in India&mdash;Hindoos
and Mahommedans. Even the young princes, sons
of the King of Delhi and descendants of the Great
Moghul, used frequently to honour Mr. Skinner with
their company. The title by which they were usually
greeted was Sahiban-i-Alum, signifying "Lords of the
World." But the most remarkable native that I ever
met at Mr. Skinner's hospitable board was the late
Maharajah Hindoo-Rao, a little, fat, round Mahratta
chieftain, with small twinkling eyes, and a countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
replete with fun and quiet humour. He was
a pensioner of the Gwalior State, and drew therefrom
twelve thousand pounds a year, which was guaranteed
to him by the British Government. Large as
was this income, Hindoo-Rao contrived annually to
spend more than double the amount, trusting continually
to fate to relieve him from his pressing pecuniary
difficulties; not that he ever suffered them to
prey upon his mind; on the contrary, he made them a
subject of jocularity. In addition to being as hospitable
as his friend Mr. Skinner, Hindoo-Rao was addicted
to field sports on a large scale, and kept up a
very large establishment for the purpose of gratifying
this propensity. He was considered&mdash;and perhaps
justly, by those qualified to form an opinion&mdash;the best
shot in all India, and with his rifle he had destroyed
several hundreds (some say thousands) of tigers.
Hindoo-Rao had another very expensive hobby. He
desired to possess himself of the Philosopher's Stone,
by which he might transmute metals&mdash;a mode by
which he proposed to improve the state of his finances
and eventually pay his debts. On all other points,
Hindoo-Rao was sufficiently sensible and shrewd, but
on this point he was childish, if not insane. Thousands
and thousands of pounds were squandered by him in
this absurd pursuit, for he was constantly the victim
of juggling forgers, swindlers, and rogues. His house
was on a hill immediately overhanging Delhi, and it
has recently been made famous throughout Europe as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the position of one of our batteries. Night after night
in that house would furnaces blaze, while some impostor,
who pretended to have the secret, was at work
with his chemicals.</p>

<p>I ought to mention that this Mahratta chief was a
near relation of the royal family of Gwalior, and that
he had been banished and pensioned for having been
engaged in some intrigues against the Gwalior State.</p>

<p>The Maharajah Hindoo-Rao was a great gourmand,
and those who partook of his dinners never forgot
them. It was not often that the old chief could be
induced to discuss politics, but on the occasion of the
41st Regiment of Infantry having mutinied at Delhi&mdash;a
mutiny which, by the way, was hushed up&mdash;I
heard him very energetically exclaim: "Ah! if you
go on humouring your native soldiers in this way,
they will never be satisfied until they govern the
country!"</p>

<p>The late Sir Charles James Napier visited Delhi
while I was there. He came, not as ordinary commanders-in-chief
usually come, with a large suite and
an escort covering a square mile of encamping ground,
but attended only by two aides-de-camp and a military
secretary. It was on the morning of his Excellency's
arrival that the mutiny in the 41st Regiment,
to which I have just alluded, occurred. Sir Charles
reviewed the regiments then quartered at Delhi, including
the 41st, and complimented them <i>en masse</i>!
The review over, Hindoo-Rao, who was a great horseman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
rode up to the commander-in-chief on his spirited
charger, and expressed the happiness it afforded him
to see an officer who had so distinguished himself in
the military annals of his country. Sir Charles appeared
much pleased with the open, frank manner and
independent bearing of the old Mahratta chieftain,
and accepted, on behalf of himself and his staff, an
invitation to dine with him that evening. A large
number of gentlemen, European and native, assembled
to meet his Excellency; and when Sir Charles returned
thanks for the honour that had been paid to
him in drinking his health, he made allusion to the
pleasure that it afforded him in seeing Christians,
Hindoos, and Mussulmen on such good terms, and
living together in such amity and concord. What a
change since that evening, which to me seems but as
yesterday! Several of our party, on that occasion,
have become chiefs of the recent rebellion, and were
accessory to the massacre of English gentlemen and
ladies.</p>

<p>Hindoo-Rao died in eighteen hundred and fifty-four.
His funeral was thus described to me by a
friend who witnessed it: "They dressed up the old
gentleman's corpse in his most magnificent costume,
covered his arms with jewelled bracelets of gold, with
costly necklaces of pearls and diamonds hanging down
to his waist, placed him in a chair of state, sat him
bolt upright&mdash;just as he used to sit when alive&mdash;and
thus, attended by his relations, friends, and suite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
he was carried through Delhi to the banks of the
Jumna, where the body was burnt with the usual rites,
and the ashes thrown into the river."</p>

<p>Mr. Skinner also is dead. He died in eighteen
hundred and fifty-five. When I think of him I am
rejoiced that he did not survive to be brutally massacred,
as his brothers have been; or to see his house
(near the Cashmere Gate) which was always the scene
of good-fellowship and good-feeling, turned into a battery
by the rebels; or the church, built by his father,
burned and destroyed by the people who had for
years and years paid, or affected to pay, unqualified
respect and devotion to his family.</p>

<p>I made the acquaintance of another personage at
Delhi, for whom I had a very great liking and regard.
This was Mirza Futteh Allee Shah Bahadoor, the heir
apparent to the throne of Delhi. He was a very
amiable and intelligent prince, and had an extraordinary
thirst for knowledge. Amongst other things
that he was curious to learn was the history of steam
power, railroads, and the electric telegraph. For hours
together he would encourage me&mdash;nay, importune me,
to talk with him on these matters. <i>Apropos</i> of this
prince and his family&mdash;while I was at Delhi the festival
of the Eed came to pass, and there was an omen
which was variously interpreted. The King, in other
words the Great Moghul, sacrifices a camel. The King
kills (or used to kill) the camel with his own hand,
by driving a spear into the breast of the animal. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the occasion to which I now refer, the King, being
extremely old and feeble, was assisted by two attendants,
and, in attempting to drive the spear, it broke
in two pieces. That was the omen. The friends of
Mirza Futteh Allee Shah Bahadoor interpreted it as
prognosticating the King's death and the speedy succession
of the heir apparent to the throne. Others,
however, said that it prognosticated the downfall of
the King and of his throne for ever. Mirza died
about a year ago of an attack of cholera; and it may
not be premature perhaps to say that the throne of
the Great Moghul will not in future be recognised.
There was another curious prophecy connected with
the throne of Delhi, and current for many years in
the Punjab. It was implicitly believed that the Sikh
soldiery would one day or other, and before long, sack
Delhi; and, in eighteen hundred and forty-five, when
the Sikh army crossed our frontier, Delhi was its destination.
This prophecy has to some extent been fulfilled.
The Sikh soldiers have tasted of the plunder
of Delhi. But who could ever have dreamed that
their entry into the city of the Great Moghul would
be in company with British soldiers? It is as
though, and quite as incredible as if, some one had
predicted in eighteen hundred and sixteen that, in
eighteen hundred and fifty-five, the Queen of England,
a grand-daughter of George III., would be a guest at
the Tuileries of an Emperor of the French, and a
nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte; and that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Queen would be led upon the arm of such Emperor
to visit the tomb of the Prisoner of St. Helena.</p>

<p>After leaving Delhi I crossed over to Meerut, which
was then, as it always has been since its formation, the
favourite station in the Upper Provinces of India. In
eighteen hundred and forty-six and forty-seven there
were as many as ten thousand troops quartered
at Meerut, including two regiments of British foot,
a regiment of dragoons, and three troops of horse
(European) artillery. Until lately, it has always been
deemed prudent to keep a very large European force
at Meerut in order to keep Delhi (only forty miles
distant) in check; for it was stipulated in one of our
treaties with the family of the Moghuls, that no
British infantry or cavalry, or other European troops,
should ever be quartered in the Imperial City or its
immediate vicinity. When, however, the Punjab was
annexed, the European force at Meerut was lessened
to meet the exigencies of the times; and of late
Meerut has not been, in respect to the number of
European troops, the station that it was formerly.</p>

<p>There are no ancient buildings to be seen at
Meerut. All is of European structure. The church,
the barracks, the court-houses, the treasury, the
theatre, the bungalows of the civilians and military
officers, as well as those of the merchants and "others,"
are all of brick and mortar, lath and plaster; and they
were for the most part thatched, so that the Sepoys
had very little trouble in setting fire to them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
reason why houses are commonly thatched instead of
tiled and shingled, is that the thatch keeps the interior
of the dwelling so very much cooler.</p>

<p>While at Meerut I was a guest of the editor of the
journal which used to issue from that station, and as
my stay extended over six weeks, during which period
I frequently assisted the editor in his work, I gained
some knowledge of the practical working of the press in
the Upper Provinces. I am authorized to make any
use I please of this knowledge.</p>

<p>In the first place I may mention that the order of
Government forbidding civilians or military men corresponding
with the press, was, to every intent and
purpose, a perfect farce and a dead letter. On the
staff of the Meerut paper were several gentlemen belonging
to each branch of the service. These gentlemen
not only wrote, but some of them wrote for pay&mdash;for
so much per column; while the correspondence
columns were filled with letters from covenanted
civilians or commissioned officers, judges, and magistrates,
and their subordinates; brigadiers, colonels,
majors, captains, and subalterns contributed anonymously,
whenever the spirit moved them. Ay! and
frequently the members of the staff of the Governor-General
and of the Commander-in-Chief would not
only send items of news, but comments thereon; and
I have reason to know that this practice was continued
up to the date of the recent outbreak, and is still continued.
By the way, the late Major Thomas was virtually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the editor of the <i>Mofussilite</i> at Agra at the
time he received his death wound in the field of
battle. The Delhi newspaper was also written for by
civilians and military men of all grades.</p>

<p>It was the press that introduced to the notice of
the Government many clever and able men, who had
no other interest to help them. I could mention
scores of instances, but two will suffice. Herbert
Benjamin Edwardes, of the Bengal Fusiliers, the
"Brahminee Bull" of the <i>Delhi Gazette</i>, and Mr.
Campbell, of the Civil Service, who was "given up"
to Lord Dalhousie as the "Delator" of the <i>Mofussilite</i>,
and promoted to an office of great responsibility. In
the last-mentioned paper there also appeared, in
eighteen hundred and forty-seven, forty-eight, and
forty nine, a series of leading articles on military
reform and other matters, some of which attracted
the notice of Sir Charles Napier. They came from
the pen of General (then Major) Mansfield, of the
Fifty-third Foot, and at present chief of the staff of
Sir Colin Campbell. It was not to silence these men,
who displayed their ability in the newspapers, that
they were placed in staff employ, or promoted. On
the contrary, I know that they were expected&mdash;and
in some instances requested&mdash;to use their pens in
defence of certain Government measures; and that,
on several occasions, they did vigorous battle with
their former literary chief, the editor of the paper in
which they first made their appearance in print. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
remember that on one occasion the editor, on being
beaten in an argument, headed his admission of the
fact with the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
Keen are our pangs; but keener far to feel<br />
We nursed the pinion that impels the steel.<br />
</div>

<p>There are no newsmen in the Upper Provinces of
India, nor, indeed, in any of the Presidencies. Whoever
wishes to take a journal must subscribe for a
certain period&mdash;year or half-year. The rates for the
<i>Mofussilite</i>, or <i>Delhi Gazette</i>, were three pounds
twelve shillings per annum, or two pounds per six
months. The net profits of both these papers, in
eighteen hundred and forty-nine and fifty, were upwards
of five thousand pounds per annum. With the
exception of the <i>Friend in India</i>, when under the
control of its original proprietor, these journals of the
North-West were by far the most remunerative of any
in the East.</p>

<p>There was a native newspaper published at Meerut,
called the <i>Jam-i-Jumsheed</i>, which title signifies a
bowl or glass, into which if you look, you will see
what transpires in the whole world. The history of
this paper is very curious.</p>

<p>It was founded without the knowledge, privity, or
consent of the conductor of the European journal, by
the head pressman, of his establishment, who was a
Brahmin. The editor of this native print, which was
lithographed in the Oordoo language, was the moonshee
of the English press at Meerut. He was well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
skilled in English, and his chief employment was
translating the native correspondence. Having constant
access to the desks of the compositors, this
press moonshee acquired a knowledge of every item
of news furnished by European as well as native
correspondents, and of this knowledge he failed not
to avail himself. This, however, was but a small
evil, comparatively. Unknown to the conductor of
the Meerut paper, a much greater evil arose from the
publication of the native print. Availing himself of
such sources of information, its editor seized the views
of his employer&mdash;views intended only for European
eyes, and gave his own version of them to his readers
in the Hindoostanee language; and, what was equally
mischievous, he published quantities of matter which
the conductor of the Meerut paper thought proper to
suppress after it was set up in type. These were the
morsels in which the native editor took most delight.
A single instance will suffice. The following appeared
in the leading columns of the <i>Jam-i-Jumsheed</i>, the
facts having been kept out of the columns of the
Meerut paper, at the instance of the friends of the
gentleman who was guilty of the indiscretion:-</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An act of retributive justice has just been committed by the
worthy magistrate of this district. It was supposed that an escaped
convict from the jail was secreted in a village about four miles distant
from this cantonment. In the dead of the night, the magistrate,
at the head of a large body of police, visited the village, aroused
the inhabitants from their slumbers, and demanded the culprit.
The villagers denied any knowledge of him. The magistrate, with
characteristic kindness and consideration, gave them half-an-hour to
make up their minds. At the expiration of that time, as the culprit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
was not produced, he set fire to the village. In those flames,
which illuminated the country for miles round, thirteen lives were
sacrificed; namely, those of three men, four women, and six children.
One of the unfortunate women was in labour at the time. Some
malicious natives in the neighbourhood of Meerut give out that the
Sahib has been notoriously mad for several years past. Let us hope,
however, that the Lieutenant-Governor will not heed such insinuations,
but after complimenting the magistrate on his vigour and his zeal, appoint
him to the first judgeship that may become vacant. No less
than six hundred persons are, by this fire, rendered homeless beggars.
But what of that? Must justice be obstructed?</p>

<p>It remains for us to add that the escaped convict of whom the
magistrate was in search, has been in Oude for the past month, and
that no notice of this affair will appear in any of the papers printed
in English and edited by the Sahib Logue. Those gentlemen are
far too modest to make known the manifest blessings which arise out
of British rule in India.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For upwards of a year and a-half the native paper
went on filching news, and writing in the above
strain. At length the conductor of the Meerut
journal was furnished with some information which
led to his discharging his employ√©es, the head pressman
and the moonshee, and breaking up their
journal, the <i>Jam-i-Jumsheed</i>. And more than this
was done. The danger of permitting native newspapers
to be published without any sort of supervision was
elaborately, and from time to time dwelt upon by
the English editor, and at length the Government
was moved to call for a return of the journals printed
in the Hindoostanee language in the Upper Provinces
of India, and for an account of the number of copies
that each issued. With this return and account the
Government was well satisfied; first, because the
aggregate circulation was so ridiculously small (comparatively),
that it was quite clear that the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
press had no power or influence; and, secondly, that
the tone of the best conducted and most respectable
journals of the native press were loud in their praises
of British rule, and firm supporters of the Government.
It was overlooked with reference to the first
point, that in no country, and in India especially, is
the actual circulation of a newspaper any criterion of
the number of persons acquainted with its contents,
its chief items of intelligence, and its sentiments on
the most important questions of the day. Let us take
for example, the greatest paper in the world&mdash;the
<i>Times</i>. Compare the number of copies that are
struck off daily with the number of hands into which
that paper passes, the number of eyes that read it,
and the number of ears that listen to hear it read.
As to the second point, the praise of the Government
of India, it was laughable to hear it mentioned,
albeit the subject was of so serious a character. That
praise was bestowed very much in the same spirit
that Jack Wilkes is said to have conveyed a serious
warning, with a humorous grin, to an election mob&mdash;"I
hear that it is your intention, gentlemen, to
take that person (there!) who is interrupting me,
place him under that pump, and duck him! Now,
if you should do so, no matter how much it may be
for his own good, you will&mdash;I give you this emphatic
warning&mdash;incur my most serious displeasure, gentlemen!"
They (the native editors) used to wrap up
the most bitter irony in the most complimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
phrases, and frequently their allusions, if viewed abstractedly,
were both humorous and witty. A case
in point. The late Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western
Provinces, a few years ago, presided at
an examination of the students of a Government
public school. Amongst other questions which his
honour put to the boys of the first class was this&mdash;"How
does the world go round?" The head boy, a
very intelligent Hindoo, gave an admirable reply&mdash;spoke,
as the saying is, like a book. The editor of a
native paper, in a notice of the examination, predicted
that this boy would come to a bad end for
giving such an answer to the Lieutenant-Governor of
the North-West Provinces. "He ought," said the
native editor, "when so questioned by so potent a
ruler, as to the cause of the world's going round, to
have flung science into the gutter, and, having assumed
the most cringing attitude imaginable, he should have
placed his hands together, and then have responded
meekly, 'By your honour's grace, favour, and kindness,
does this planet revolve upon its axis.'" This
same editor once wrote a notice of a ball given by
the officers of the Horse Artillery mess at Meerut to
the ladies of the Twenty-ninth Foot, on the occasion
of that last-mentioned and distinguished regiment
coming to the station. When translated, literally, to
an Englishman this notice would seem the most
flattering account possible; but, if such Englishman
took it in the sense in which Asiatics understood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
comprehended it, he would, without any sort of doubt,
have admitted that it was the most extraordinary
and ingenious admixture of satire and obscenity that
ever was printed and published!</p>

<p>The same editor, during the second Sikh campaign,
burlesqued the despatches of Lord Gough; but so
cleverly, that they were taken by English people, who
heard them translated, as genuine productions. This
was the man who never lost an opportunity of bringing
British rule in India into disgrace, ridicule, and
contempt amongst his countrymen, and who, eventually,
by producing his writings, and having them
translated literally, succeeded in obtaining an appointment
under the Government worth one hundred and
fifty rupees per mensem! The great article on which
his good fortune was based, was one descriptive of
Lord Dalhousie, on the back of an elephant, proceeding
to a spot appointed as the place of an interview
between his Lordship and the late Maharajah
Goolab Singh. Neither the London nor the Paris
<i>Charivari</i> ever surpassed this squib, so far as its spirit
of ridicule was concerned, while in point of mischief
those European journals of fun would never have
dreamed of going the lengths of the Asiatic writer.
"What became of this native editor?" may be reasonably
asked. I hear that he is now aide-de-camp and
military secretary to Bahadoor Khan, the rebel, who
is at the head of a considerable army, and, according
to the latest accounts, in possession of the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Bareilly district. He (the native editor) is a Mahommedan,
of very ancient and good family; he has
an extremely handsome person and plausible manners,
and should I again wander in India, it will not at
all surprise me to find him in the service of the
British Government, and filling some office of considerable
dignity and emolument.</p>

<p>I have incidentally spoken of the theatre at Meerut.
It was a building about the size of the Adelphi
Theatre, and was built by subscription, some twenty-five
years ago. The performers were, of course, amateurs,
officers in the civil and military services, and
now and then an interloper, possessed of histrionic
abilities. The ladies were those young gentlemen
who could be best made up to imitate the gentler
sex. The scene-painters, scene-shifters, prompters,
and so on, were men belonging to the various European
corps quartered in the station, men who had
been about, or connected with, London theatres, and
who understood their business thoroughly. On an
average, there was a performance once a fortnight.
Tragedy was seldom or never attempted; nothing
but standard comedies and approved farces. It pains
me to think of the last performance I witnessed on
the Meerut boards; for, with the exception of myself
and another gentleman, every one who had a character
assigned to him is now numbered with the dead.
The play was <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>. Claude Melnotte
was an officer in the Governor-General's Body-guard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
his height was under five feet, and his weight exactly
eight stone. Pauline was the magistrate of
Bolund-Shahur, who was six feet three, and weighed
twenty-one stone and some pounds. In short, Claude
was about the smallest, and Pauline about the biggest
man, in British India. These two died of natural
causes within the last three years. The rest have all
been massacred or killed in action. Some perished
at Cawnpore, and other stations, and some have
fallen before Delhi and before Lucknow. And, alas!
amongst the audience of that night, how many have
since been prematurely despatched from this world&mdash;men,
women, and children!</p>

<p>There are some matters connected with theatricals
in India, in the Upper Provinces, which would strike
any gentleman or lady fresh from Europe as very
odd. Huge punkahs are suspended from the ceiling,
and pulled by natives during the performance.
Without the punkahs the heat in the house would be
unbearable. Then, there are no boxes, and there is
no pit. One part of the house, that nearest to the
stage, is set apart for the officers civil and military,
and their wives and families. The rest of the house
is generally filled by non-commissioned officers and
private soldiers. As a matter of course, the greatest
order prevails throughout the play, which is usually
produced "under the patronage of the officer commanding
the station and his lady." The actors are
never hissed; but the applause, in which the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
always join, is loud, long, frequent, and encouraging.</p>

<p>In most of the large stations, where European
troops are quartered&mdash;such stations as Meerut, Agra,
Umballah, Cawnpore, Lahore&mdash;the non-commissioned
officers and men of the regiments get up theatrical
performances, which are attended by the society,
And very creditably, too, do they perform. I have
seen a sergeant of the 8th Foot (Colonel Greathead's
regiment) play, at Agra, the character of Doctor
O'Toole, in <i>The Irish Tutor</i>, in a style and with a
racy humour which reminded me more of the late
Mr. Power than any actor on the metropolitan or provincial
boards in England ever did. And at Umballah,
I have seen a corporal of the Third Dragoons
act the part of <i>The Stranger</i> in a way that moved an
audience, "unused, albeit to the melting mood," in
the literal sense of the phrase, to involuntary tears.
But by far the best actor (I am speaking of non-professionals)
that I ever listened to, considering the
range of characters that he played, was a private in
the 9th Lancers. I would have gone night after
night, to see him in tragedy, comedy, or farce; or
even to hear him sing a sentimental or a comic song.
He was a younger brother of an intelligent, influential,
rich, and deservedly respected London tradesman,
whose name is known in every quarter of the
world where the English language is spoken. It
behoves me to say that these three men (who, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the way, are all dead) were possessed of great
general ability, and had, respectively, received a good
education.</p>

<p>It is not for a wanderer and an interloper like
myself to make any suggestions to an enlightened (I
use the word advisedly) Government; but I do hope
that when order is restored throughout our Eastern
dominions, when the affairs of the country are a
matter of local consideration, the health, comfort, and
recreation of the British soldier in those hot plains
will command more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed upon them. I hope to see barracks in
which the men can live in comparative comfort&mdash;barracks
lofty and spacious, and fitted with punkahs,
and other conveniences such as are required for the
climate, and such as one always finds in the abodes of
officers and gentlemen. I hope to see separate sleeping
apartments for the married couples, and separate
sleeping apartments for the mass of children above
seven and eight years of age. I hope never again to
see men, women, young girls, and boys, and infant
children, so huddled together that those who escaped
demoralization ought to have been exhibited as
curiosities of the human species. I hope never
again to behold white children, girls of thirteen
years of age, the offspring of British soldiers, married,
in order that they might remain in the regiment.</p>

<p>"Surely," I once remarked to the Colonel of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Royal regiment in India, who made some remarks on
the painful topic last alluded to&mdash;"Surely this might
be obviated?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my good sir," was his reply. "But it would
cost this Government an outlay of a few thousands of
rupees. A little while ago I had a battle with the
Government. I insisted on having punkahs hung up
in the barracks, and I spoke in a tone so decided that
even the frowsy military board&mdash;composed of several
very old and feeble Company's officers of the last century&mdash;was
frightened into something like activity.
Well, sir, the punkahs were suspended, and I fancied
that I had gained an immense triumph; but I was
very much mistaken. It was a case of 'There are
your punkahs, and now let your men pull them, or
employ the natives to do so!' So that the punkahs,
after all, instead of promoting a current of fresh air,
impeded it, and served only as perches for the flies,
and cobweb-booms for the spiders. The idea of the
poor men paying for punkah coolies!"</p>

<p>"What would it cost to punkah the whole regiment
during the hot season?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I can tell you exactly," said the colonel: "for I
have made a correct estimate. The cost for the five
hot months would be under three hundred pounds;
and by laying out this sum the Government would
save some three thousand or four thousand pounds
a-year, at the very least."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Many men cannot bear the heat of these barrack
rooms, crowded as they are, and left without punkahs.
The consequence is, that they become ill, go into
hospital and die there, or spend the greater part of
their time there. I should say that if the men had
better accommodation, and the same means as <i>we
officers</i> have of keeping their apartments cool, we
should save in every regiment fifty lives annually.
Now, every recruit who comes from home and joins a
regiment in the Upper Provinces, to fill up a death or
casualty in the ranks, costs the Indian Government a
hundred and ten pounds sterling. I have pointed all
this out; but it is of no use."</p>

<p>"I would report it to the Horse Guards," said I.</p>

<p>"I did so, two years ago."</p>

<p>"And what did the Horse Guards say in reply to
your statements?"</p>

<p>"Precisely what the learned world said of poor
George Primrose's paradoxes&mdash;they said nothing.
They treated them with dignified silence, and perhaps
contempt. However, I did not stop there. I went
further."</p>

<p>"You addressed the Throne, or Prince Albert?"</p>

<p>"No; I did not go so far as that. We had just
got the Albert hat out, and after a careful examination
of it, I came to the conclusion that his Royal
Highness would hardly be disposed to give much ear
to my complaint touching the discomfort of the
British troops in India. But I wrote to an elder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
brother of mine, who represents a borough in Parliament,
and I begged of him to bring under the notice
of the House of Commons the condition of the British
soldier in India, and move for a report of the officers
in command of the various regiments doing duty in
this country."</p>

<p>"And he did so, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Not he. He wrote to me to say that he had
never spoken in the House, and never intended doing
so, as he had not the faintest ambition to become a
public orator; but that he had shown my letter to
several friends of his (members of Parliament), who
would only be too glad of an opportunity of bringing
themselves into notice; and that they, one and all,
blew upon it, remarking that the condition of the
British soldier in any part of the world was a frightful
bore; but that the condition of the British soldier
in the East was a bore utterly beyond toleration.
'My dear George,' (he went on to say to me), 'your
story would only be received with an ironical hear,
hear! followed by a series of coughs, as though the
subject had given the House a sudden chill and a
very bad cold. Even that garrulous goose, Jamsey,
to whom (in despair, and in order to oblige you) I
showed your letter&mdash;even Jamsey, who is always
ready to talk for hours about everything or anybody,
shrugged his shoulders, shook his head, sighed, lifted
up his hands, groaned, <i>It won't do</i>, and left me.
Find out some indigo-planter who has been, or is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
supposed to be, guilty of some sort of oppression
towards a sable cultivator of the soil, and we will
pretty soon grind his bones to make our bread, my
boy; but, for Heaven's sake, and the sake of the
House of Commons, don't inflict upon us your British
soldiers."</p>

<p>To leave the colonel, and express my further hopes&mdash;I
hope to see in every large station throughout
India two Christian churches erected&mdash;one for the
Protestants and another for the Roman Catholics.
Both erected at the expense of the Government. I
hope to see, also, in every large station, a library to
which every soldier, at stated hours, shall have access.
I hope to see soldiers' gardens&mdash;such as the late Sir
Henry Lawrence recommended&mdash;in which the men
may, when they feel disposed, work, or amuse themselves
in the cold season. I hope to see a theatre in
every large station built and kept in repair, not by
subscription from the poor men, but at the cost of the
State. I hope, in fact to see the British soldier in
the East&mdash;not petted, pampered, and made a fuss of,
but made as sensibly comfortable as the climate in
which he serves will admit of his being made. I
hope, from the bottom of my heart, never to see
brave men put into such a barrack as that at Loodianah,
which fell in upon, and buried in its ruins, the
remnant of her Majesty's 50th Regiment of Foot:
one of the most gallant regiments in the Army List.
They went into the field, during the first Sikh campaign,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
nine hundred strong. Nine hundred bright
bayonets glittered in the sun as they marched away
to give the foe (in the words of Lord Gough) "a taste
of cold stale." They were at Moodkee, Ferozeshah,
Aliwal, and Sobraon. Out of that nine hundred,
only three hundred returned to quarters in March,
eighteen hundred and forty-six. In three months,
six hundred had fallen in battle! The campaign
over, they were quartered at Loodianah, and placed
in barracks which had been frequently reported rotten,
unsound, and dangerous. But of this report&mdash;though
forwarded by the Commander-in-chief&mdash;the military
board took no notice. The consequence was, that in
a dust-storm on the night of the twenty-first of May,
ten years ago, the barracks came down! Beneath
that mass of dust and smoke, and unburnt bricks, lay
all the men, women, and children, left to represent
the glorious 50th Regiment of Foot! Beneath
that mass were the heroes who had escaped the carnage
of the battle-fields in which three to one of the
Regiment had died! Fifty-one men, eighteen women,
and twenty-nine children, were killed by the fall of
those barracks; one hundred and twenty-six men,
thirty-nine women, and thirty-four children, were
badly wounded&mdash;many maimed and disfigured for
life! Well might the Colonel of that regiment cry
aloud, "My God! there is no 50th left! The
enemy did its worst; but it is the Company Bahadoor
that has given us the finishing blow!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The English reader may possibly doubt the accuracy
of these details; but there is a huge grave at
Loodianah containing the bones of those men, women,
and children of the 50th; and scores of officers still
live to bear testimony to the truth of my assertions
in respect to this horrible catastrophe.</p>

<p>The engineer at Loodianah was written to by the
secretary of the Military Board, and asked why he had
not made a report of the state of the barracks which
had fallen in? He replied that he had written three
letters on the subject, and that his predecessor in office
had written seven; and the foolish man was stupid
enough to ransack the records of his office, and "had
the honour to transmit for information of the Board
copies of these documents." For this absurd effort
of memory, and ridiculous attempt to clear himself of
blame, he was removed from his appointment, and
sent to do duty with the Sappers and Miners&mdash;a sort of
very severe punishment in the East for any engineer
officer guilty of an indiscretion.</p>

<h2>CHURCHYARDS, ETC.</h2>


<p>I cannot leave Meerut without taking the reader to
the churchyard of that station.</p>

<p>An Indian churchyard presents a very different
aspect to a churchyard in England or elsewhere.
The tombs for the most part are very much larger.
When first erected or newly done up they are as white
as snow, formed, as they are generally, of chunam
(plaster), which somewhat resembles Roman cement;
but after exposure to only one rainy season and one
hot weather, they become begrimed and almost black.
The birds flying from structure to structure carry with
them the seeds of various plants and herbs, and these
if not speedily removed take root and grow apace. A
stranger wandering in the churchyard of Meerut might
fancy that he is amidst ruins of stupendous antiquity,
if he were not aware of the fact that fifty years have
scarcely elapsed since the first Christian corpse was
deposited within those walls which now encircle some
five acres of ground, literally covered with tombs, in
every stage of preservation and decay. I was conducted
in my ramble through the Meerut churchyard
by an old and very intelligent pensioner, who had
originally been a private in a regiment of Light Dragoons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
This old man lived by the churchyard, that
is to say, he derived a very comfortable income from
looking after and keeping in repair the tombs of
those whose friends are now far away; but whose
thoughts nevertheless still turn occasionally to that
Christian enclosure in the land of heathens and
idolaters.</p>

<p>"I get, sir, for this business," said the old man,
pointing with his stick to a very magnificent edifice,
"two pounds a year. It is not much, but it is what
I asked, and it pays me very well, sir. And if you
should go back to England, and ever come across any
of her family, I hope, sir, you will tell them that I do
my duty by the grave; not that I think they have
any doubt of it, for they must know&mdash;or, leastways,
they have been told by them they can believe&mdash;that
if I never received a farthing from them I would
always keep it in repair, as it is now. God bless her,
and rest her soul! She was as good and as beautiful
a woman as ever trod this earth."</p>

<p>"Who was she?"</p>

<p>"The wife of an officer in my old regiment, sir. I
was in her husband's troop. He's been out twice
since the regiment went home, only to visit this
grave; for he has long since sold out of the service,
and is a rich gentleman. The last time he came was
about five years ago. He comes what you call <i>incog.</i>;
nobody knows who he is, and he never calls on anybody.
All that he now does in this country is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
come here, stop for three days and nights, putting up
at the d√¢k bungalow, and spending his time here,
crying. It is there that he stands, where you stand
now, fixing his eyes on the tablet, and sometimes laying
his head down on the stone, and calling out her
name: 'Ellen! Ellen! My own dear Ellen!' He
did love her, sure<i>ly</i>, sir."</p>

<p>"Judging from the age of the lady, twenty-three,
and the date of her death, he must be rather an old
man now."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He must be more than sixty; but his
love for her memory is just as strong as ever. She
died of a fever, poor thing. And for that business,"
he again pointed with his stick to a tomb admirably
preserved, "I used to get two pounds ten shillings a-year.
That is the tomb of a little girl of five years
old, the daughter of a civilian. The parents are now
dead. They must be, for I have not heard of 'em or
received anything from 'em for more than six years
past."</p>

<p>"Then who keeps the tomb in repair?"</p>

<p>"I do, sir. When I am here, with my trowel and
mortar, and whitewash, why shouldn't I make the
outside of the little lady's last home on earth as
bright and as fair as those of her friends and neighbours?
I have a nursery of 'em, as I call it, over in
yonder corner&mdash;the children's corner. Some of 'em
are paid for, others not; but when I'm there doing
what's needful, I touch 'em up all alike, bless their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
dear little souls. And somehow or other every good
action meets its own reward, and often when we least
expect it. Now, for instance, sir, about three years
and a half ago, I was over there putting the nursery
in good order, when up comes a grey-headed gentleman,
and looks about the graves. Suddenly he
stopped opposite to one and began to read, and presently
he took out his pocket handkerchief and put it
to his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Did you know that little child, sir?' said I,
when it was not improper to speak. 'Know it?' said
he, 'yes. It was my own little boy.' 'Dear me, sir!'
I answered him. 'And you are, then, Lieutenant
Statterleigh?' 'I was,' said he; 'but I am now the
colonel of a regiment that has just come to India, and
is now stationed at Dinapore. But tell me, who keeps
this grave in order?' 'I do, sir,' says I. 'At whose
expense?' says he. 'At nobody's, sir,' says I. 'It is
kept in order by the dictates of my own conscience.
Your little boy is in good company here; and while
I am whitening the tombs of the other little dears,
I have it not in my heart to pass by his without
giving it a touch also.' Blest if he didn't take me
to the house where he was staying, and give me
five hundred rupees! That sort of thing has happened
to me more than five or six times in my life,
not that I ever hope or think of being paid for such
work and labour when I am about it."</p>

<p>"That must have been a magnificent affair," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
I, pointing to a heap of red stone and marble. "But
how comes it in ruins?"</p>

<p>"It is just as it was left, sir. The lady died. Her
husband, a judge here, took on terribly; and ordered
that tomb for her. Some of the stone was brought
from Agra, some from Delhi; but before it was put
together and properly erected, he married again, and
the work was stopped. I was present at the funeral.
There was no getting him away after the service was
over, and at last they had to resort to force and violence&mdash;in
fact, to carry him out of the yard. But the
shallowest waters, as the proverb says, sir, always
make the most noise, while those are the deepest
that flow on silently. Yonder is a funny tomb, sir,"
continued the old man, again pointing with his stick.
"There! close to the tomb of the lady which I first
showed you."</p>

<p>"How do you mean funny?" I asked, observing
nothing particular in the structure.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it is funny only on account of the history
of the two gentlemen whose remains it covers,"
replied the old man, leading me to the tomb. "One
of these young gentlemen, sir, was an officer&mdash;a lieutenant&mdash;in
the Bengal Horse Artillery; the other
was an ensign in a Royal Regiment of the Line.
There was a ball, and by some accident that beautiful
lady of our regiment had engaged herself to both of
them for the same dance. When the time came,
both went up and claimed her hand. Neither of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
them would give way, and the lady not wishing
to offend either by showing a preference, and
finding herself in a dilemma, declined to dance with
either. Not satisfied with this, they retired to the
verandah, where they had some high words, and the
next morning they met, behind the church there, and
fought a duel, in which both of them fell, mortally
wounded. They had scarcely time to shake hands
with one another when they died. In those days
matters of the kind were very easily hushed up; and
it was given out, though everybody knew to the contrary,
that one had died of fever and the other of
cholera, and they were both buried side by side in one
grave; and this tomb was erected over them at the
joint expense of the two regiments to which they
belonged. I get ten rupees a year for keeping this
grave in order."</p>

<p>"Who pays you?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman in Calcutta, a relation of one of
them. I'll tell you what it is, sir. This foolish affair,
which ended so fatally, sowed the seeds of the fever
that carried off that beautiful and good woman yonder.
She was maddened by the thought of being the cause
of the quarrel in which they lost their lives. I knew
them both, sir, from seeing them so often on the
parade ground and at the band-stand; very fine
young men they were, sir. Yes; here they sleep in
peace."</p>

<p>"Whose tombs are those?" I asked, pointing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
some two or three hundred which were all exactly
alike, and in three straight lines; in other words,
three deep.</p>

<p>"Those are the tombs of the men of the Cameronians,
sir. These graves are all uniform, as you observe.
Fever made sad havoc with that regiment.
They lost some three companies in all. Behind them
are the tombs of the men of the Buffs, and behind them
the tombs of the men of other Royal Regiments of Infantry&mdash;all
uniform you see, sir; but those of each
regiment rather differently shaped. To the right,
flanking the Infantry tombs, are the tombs of the
men of the Cavalry, 8th and 11th Dragoons, and 16th
Lancers. In the rear of the Cavalry are the tombs
of the Horse and Foot Artillerymen&mdash;all uniform you
see, sir. Egad! if they could rise just now, what a
pretty little army they would form, of all ranks, some
thousands of 'em, and well officered, too, they would
be; and here a man to lead them. This is the tomb
of Major-General Considine, one of the most distinguished
men in the British army. He was the
officer that the Duke of Wellington fixed upon to
bring the 53rd Foot into good order, when they ran
riot in Gibraltar some years ago. This is the tomb of
General Considine, rotting and going rapidly to
decay, though it was only built in the year 1845.
A great deal of money is squandered in the churchyards
in India. Tombs are erected, and at a
great expense frequently. After they are once put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
up it is very seldom that they are visited or heeded.
Tens of thousands of pounds have been thrown away
on the vast pile of bricks and mortar and stone that
you now see within this enclosure, and with the exception
of a few all are crumbling away. A Hindoo&mdash;a
sweeper&mdash;said to me the other day in this graveyard,
'Why don't you English burn your dead as we
do, instead of leaving their graves here, to tell us how
much you can neglect them and how little you care
for them? What is the use of whitening a few
sepulchres amidst this mass of black ruin?' I had no
answer to give the fellow, sir; indeed the same thought
had often occurred to me while at work in this wilderness.
Do you not think, sir, that the government,
through its own executive officers, ought to expend a
few hundred pounds every year on these yards, in order
to avert such a scandal and disgrace? I do not speak
interestedly. I have as much already on my hands
as I can perform, if not more; but I do often think
that there is really some reason in the remarks of that
sweeper. All these graves that you see here so
blackened and left to go to ruin, are the graves of men
who have served their country and died in its service.
Very little money would keep the yard free from this
grass and these rank weeds, and very little more would
make all these tombs fit to be seen; for neither labour
nor whitewash is expensive in this part of the world.
One would hardly suppose, on looking about him just
now, that the sons and daughters of some of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
families in England are buried here, and that in a very
short time no one will be able to distinguish the spot
where each is lying; so defaced and so much alike
will all the ruins become. What, sir, I repeat, is the
use of throwing away money in building tombs, if they
are not kept in repair? Instead of laying out fifty or
a hundred pounds on a thing like this, why not lay
out only five pounds on a single head-stone, and put
the rest out at interest to keep it up?"</p>

<p>"Or a small slab with an iron railing round it?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir; but then you would require an European
to remain here, and a couple of native watchmen to
see that the railings were not carried off by the villagers.
As it is, they never allow an iron railing to remain
longer than a week, or so long as that. They
watch for an opportunity, jump over this low wall, and
tear them down, or wrench them off and away with
them."</p>

<p>"But surely there is some one to watch the yard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, two sweepers&mdash;men of the lowest caste of
Hindoos. And when it is found out that a grave has
been plundered of its railings, or that the little marble
tablet, which some have, has been taken away, they
deny all knowledge of the matter, and are simply
discharged, and two others of the same caste are put
into their places. It would not be much to build a
comfortable little bungalow for an European&mdash;a man
like myself, for instance&mdash;and give the yard into his
charge, holding him responsible for any damage done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and requiring him to see that the grave of every
Christian&mdash;man, woman, and child&mdash;is kept in good
order. But horrible as is the condition of this churchyard&mdash;looking
as it does, for the most part, more like
a receptacle for the bodies of felons than those of good
and brave soldiers and civilians, and their wives and
children&mdash;it is really nothing when compared with
the graveyard of Kernaul. Kernaul, you know, sir,
was our great frontier station some twenty years ago.
It was, in fact, as large a station as Umballah now is.
It had its church, its play-house, its barracks for
cavalry, infantry, and artillery, its mess-houses, magnificent
bungalows, and all the rest of it. For some
reason or other&mdash;but what that reason was I could,
never discover, nor anybody else to my knowledge&mdash;the
station was abandoned with all its buildings,
which cost the government and private individuals
lacs and lacs of rupees. You may be pretty sure that
the villagers were not long in plundering every house
that was unprotected. Away went the doors and
windows, the venetians, and every bar, bolt, nail, or
bit of iron upon which they could lay their fingers;
not content with this, the brutes set fire to many or
nearly all of the thatched bungalows, in the hope of
picking up something amongst the ruins. The
church&mdash;the largest and best in the Upper Provinces,
with no one to take care of it&mdash;was one of the first
places that suffered. Like the other buildings, it was
despoiled of its doors, windows, benches, bolts, nails,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
&amp;c., and they carried away every marble tablet
therein erected, and removeable without much difficulty.
And the same kind of havoc was made in the
burial-ground&mdash;the tombs were smashed, some of the
graves, and especially the vaults, opened; and plainly
enough was it to be seen, that the low caste men had
broken open the coffins and examined their contents,
in the hope of finding a ring, or an ear-ring, or some
other ornament on the person of the dead. I went
there a year ago on some business connected with the
grave of a lady, whose husband wished her remains to
be removed to Meerut, and placed in the same vault
with those of his sister, who died here about eighteen
months since. I was not successful, however. There
was no trace of her tomb. It was of stone, and had
been taken away bodily, to pave the elephant shed or
camel yard, perhaps, of some rich native in the neighbourhood.
Looking around me, as I did, and
remembering Kernaul when it was crowded with
Europeans, it seemed to me as though the British
had been turned out of the country by the natives,
and that the most sacred spot in the cantonment had
been desecrated out of spite or revenge. And it is
just what they would do if ever they got the upper
hand."</p>

<p>[Whilst I write, it has just occurred to me that
this old soldier and his family perished in the massacre
at Meerut on the 10th of May. He was in
some way related to, or connected by marriage with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
Mrs. Courtenay, the keeper of the hotel, who, with
her nieces, was so barbarously murdered on that disastrous
occasion.]</p>

<p>"Why, bless my soul!" exclaimed the old man,
stooping down and picking up something, "if the old
gentleman hasn't shed his skin again! This is the
skin of a very large snake, a cobra capella, that I
have known for the last thirteen years. He must be
precious old from his size, the slowness of his movements,
and the bad cough he has had for the last four
or five years. Last winter he was very bad indeed,
and I thought he was going to die. He was then
living in the ruins of old General Webster's vault
and coughing continually, just like a man with the
asthma. However, I strewed a lot of fine ashes and
some bits of wool in the ruin to keep him warm by
night, and some fine white sand at the entrance, upon
which he used to crawl out and bask, when the sun
had made it hot enough; and when the warm weather
set in he got all right again."</p>

<p>"Rather a strange fancy of yours, to live upon such
amicable terms with the great enemy of the human
race?"</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it is. But he once bit and killed a
thief who came here to rob a child's grave of the iron
railings, which its parents, contrary to my advice, had
placed round it, and ever since then I have liked the
snake, and have never thought of molesting him. I
have had many an opportunity of killing him (if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
had wished to do it) when I have caught him asleep
on the tombstones, in the winter's sun. I could kill
him this very day&mdash;this very hour&mdash;if I liked, for I
know where he is at this very moment. He is in a
hole, close to the Ochterlony monument there, in that
corner of the yard. But why should I hurt him?
He has never offered to do me any harm, and when
I sing, as I sometimes do, when I am alone here at
work on some tomb or other, he will crawl up, and
listen for two or three hours together. One morning,
while he was listening, he came in for a good meal
which lasted him some days."</p>

<p>"How was this?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you, sir. A minar was chased by a
small hawk, and in despair came and perched itself
on the top of a most lofty tomb at which I was at
work. The hawk, with his eyes fixed intently on his
prey, did not, I fancy, see the snake lying motionless
in the grass; or if he did see him he did not think
he was a snake, but something else&mdash;my crowbar,
perhaps. After a little while the hawk pounced
down, and was just about to give the minar a blow
and a grip, when the snake suddenly lifted his head,
raised his hood, and hissed. The hawk gave a shriek,
fluttered, flapped his wings with all his might, and
tried very hard to fly away. But it would not
do. Strong as the eye of the hawk was, the eye of
the snake was stronger. The hawk for a time
seemed suspended in the air; but at last he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
obliged to come down, and sit opposite to the old
gentleman (the snake) who commenced, with his
forked tongue, and keeping his eyes upon him all the
while, to slime his victim all over. This occupied
him for at least forty minutes, and by the time the
process was over the hawk was perfectly motionless.
I don't think he was dead. But he was very soon,
however, for the old gentleman put him into a coil or
two, and crackled up every bone in the hawk's body.
He then gave him another sliming, made a big
mouth, distended his neck till it was as big round as
the thickest part of my arm, and down went the
hawk like a shin of beef into a beggarman's bag."</p>

<p>"And what became of the minar?"</p>

<p>"He was off like a shot, sir, the moment his enemy
was in trouble, and no blame to him. What a funny
thing nature is altogether, sir! I very often think
of that scene when I am at work here."</p>

<p>"But this place must be infested with snakes?"</p>

<p>"I have never seen but that one, sir, and I have
been here for a long time. Would you like to see
the old gentleman, sir? As the sun is up, and the
morning rather warm, perhaps he will come out, if I
pretend to be at work and give him a ditty. If he
does not, we will look in upon him."</p>

<p>"Come along," said I.</p>

<p>I accompanied the old man to a tomb, close to the
monument beneath which the snake was said to have
taken up his abode. I did not go very near to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
spot, but stood upon a tomb with a thick stick in my
hand, quite prepared to slay the monster if he approached
me; for from childhood I have always had
an instinctive horror of reptiles of every species, caste,
and character.</p>

<p>The old man began to hammer away with his
mallet and chisel, and to sing a very quaint old song
which I had never heard before, and have never
heard since. It was a dialogue or duet between the
little finger and the thumb, and began thus. The
thumb said:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"Dear Rose Mary Green!</span><br />
When I am king, little finger, you shall be queen."<br />
</div>

<p>The little finger replied:</p>

<div class="poem">
"Who told you so, Thummy, Thummy? Who told you so?"<br />
</div>

<p>The thumb responded:</p>

<div class="poem">
"It was my own heart, little finger, who told me so!"<br />
</div>

<p>The thumb then drew a very flattering picture of
the life they would lead when united in wedlock, and
concluded, as nearly as I can remember, thus:</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Thumb.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
"And when you are dead, little finger, as it may hap,<br />
You shall be buried, little finger, under the tap."<br />
</div>
<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Little Finger.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="poem">"Why, Thummy, Thummy? Why, Thummy, Thummy? Why, Thummy, Thummy&mdash;<i>Why</i>?"<br />
</div>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">Thumb.</span><br />
</div>
<div class="poem">
"That you may drink, little finger, when you are dry?"<br />
</div>

<p>But this ditty did not bring out the snake. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
remarked this to the old man, who replied: "He
hasn't made his toilet yet&mdash;hasn't rubbed his scales
up, sir; but he'll be here presently. You will see.
Keep your eye on that hole, sir. I am now going to
give him a livelier tune, which is a great favourite of
his"; and forthwith he struck up an old song, beginning</p>

<div class="poem">
"'Twas in the merry month of May,<br />
When bees from flower to flower did hum."<br />
</div>

<p>Out came the snake before the song was half over!
Before it was concluded he had crawled slowly and
(if I dare use such a word) rather majestically, to
within a few paces of the spot where the old man
was standing.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you, sir," said the old man to
the snake. "I am happy to see you in your new suit
of clothes. I have picked up your old suit, and I have
got it in my pocket, and a very nice pair of slippers
my old wife will make out of it. The last pair that
she made of your rejected apparel were given as a
present to Colonel Cureton, who, like myself, very
much resembled the great General Bl√ºcher in personal
appearance. Who will get the pair of which I
have now the makings, Heaven only knows. Perhaps
old Brigadier White, who has also a Bl√ºcher cut
about him. What song would you like next? 'Kathleen
Mavourneen?' Yes, I know that is a pet song
of yours; and you shall have it."</p>

<p>The old man sung the melody with a tenderness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and feeling which quite charmed me, as well as the
snake, who coiled himself up and remained perfectly
still. Little reason as I had to doubt the truth
of any of the old man's statements, I certainly should
have been sceptical as to the story of the snake if I
had not witnessed the scene I have attempted to
describe.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the old man, coming up to me,
after he had made a salaam to the snake and left him,
"it is almost breakfast-time, and I will, with your
permission, bid you good morning."</p>

<p>I thanked him very much for his information, and
suffered him to depart; and then, alone, I wandered
about that well-filled piece of ground. I have always
had a melancholy pleasure in strolling from tombstone
to tombstone, and reading the various epitaphs,
and on that morning, after all that I had heard from
the old pensioner, I was just in the humour for gratifying
this morbid desire.</p>

<p>Some miles to the northward of Meerut is the
station of Burnampore. No troops are quartered
here; it is what is called in India a purely civil
station, containing only a magistrate (who is also the
collector of the revenue), an assistant (a covenanted
civilian), the establishment of the office, and a small
police force. To these two gentlemen and their few
subordinates were entrusted the care and the collections
of a district as large as Lancashire or Yorkshire,
and containing, possibly, as many inhabitants. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
idea of two gentlemen keeping in order a district of
such dimensions was simply absurd; but they did
their best, and that was all that could be expected of
them. I remained four days and nights at Burnampore,
and during that time was a guest of the assistant
magistrate, whose acquaintance I had made at Meerut.
Anything more monotonous and dreary than the
existence of a gentleman stationed at such a place
it would be very difficult to imagine. My host
assured me that if it were not for an occasional
visit paid by some traveller on his way up or down
the country, both himself and his superior officer
would have died of ennui. "If it were not for the
shooting, which is very good in this district," he added,
"I would rather be a permanent passenger on board
ship, or the inmate of a debtors' prison in London, or
any other part of England&mdash;in either case, one would
have something like company, and one would have,
at all events, a somewhat cooler and more congenial
climate."</p>

<p>In the district of Burnampore there are a great
number of wolves, and during my short stay, even, two
were brought in, and the Government reward (two
rupees a-head) claimed upon them. These ferocious
creatures often carry off the young children of poor
people and devour them. It was in this district that
"a wolf child," as the natives of India express it, was
found some years ago, and taken to Meerut, where it
was exhibited as a curiosity. "There can be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
question," said my friend and host, when I spoke to
him one morning on this subject, "that the male wolf,
in all these cases, seizes and runs off with the infant,
and that when he has carried it alive to the den,
the female, especially if she happens to have cubs at
the time, instead of killing and devouring, suckles
and fosters the little human being. So, after all, the
story of Romulus and Remus may not be a mere
fable."</p>

<p>"No," said I. "But what is that Greek epigram
from the Anthology of Bland and Merivale? The
she-goat that suckled the whelp of a wolf, which wolf,
when she had no more milk to give it, killed her and
eat her. Something about</p>

<div class="poem">
'Be kind, be gentle, and do what you will,<br />
A stubborn nature will be nature still.'"<br />
</div>

<p>"Yes," replied my host. "I do remember something
about it; and by and bye we will talk the
matter over, and refer to the volume, which I have
amongst my books; but at present you must excuse
me, for I have a duty to perform. You may come
with me and witness the operation, if you like; but
understand me, I shall not be offended if you decline
to do so."</p>

<p>"What operation?"</p>

<p>"That of hanging."</p>

<p>"What? Hanging! Hanging what?</p>

<p>"A man&mdash;a culprit&mdash;a murderer. Is is a part of
my duty to see this operation performed. Come,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
he added energetically, and slapping me on the
shoulder. "Come, be a sort of Selwyn for once in
your life."</p>

<p>Whilst I was hesitating, the magistrate approached
in his buggy. He had been taking his morning
drive, and had dropt in upon his assistant to have
some friendly conversation. He had forgotten all
about the forthcoming execution; and, on hearing
that we were just about to start for the spot, he
very kindly offered to take us there&mdash;an offer
which was accepted by his assistant with many
thanks. So, off we drove, three in a gig, like so
many men going to witness a pugilistic encounter
in England during the beginning of the present
century.</p>

<p>When we had arrived at the place of execution,
a field some distance from the gaol, in which had
been erected a temporary gallows, I was surprised at
not finding a mob. There was no one there but the
culprit&mdash;who was eating as much rice as he could, and
as fast as he could&mdash;a couple of native policemen
with drawn swords guarding him; the gaoler, who
was a Mahommedan, and a Bengalee writer (clerk),
who stood with pen, ink, and paper in hand, ready
to dot down the official particulars of the scene, preparatory
to their being forwarded to Government,
according to a certain regulation.</p>

<p>"Is everything ready?" said the assistant magistrate
to the gaoler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib," he replied; "but he has not yet
finished his breakfast."</p>

<p>"In one minute, Sahib," cried the culprit, who
overheard the conversation; and hastily taking into
his stomach the few grains of rice that remained
upon the dish, and drinking the remainder of his
half-gallon of milk, he sprang up, and called out the
word "Tyear!" signifying "I am ready." He was
then led up to the scaffold, the most primitive affair
that I ever beheld. It was only a piece of woodwork
resembling a large crock or crate in which a dinner-service
is packed for exportation. Upon this crock,
which was placed under the beam, he was requested
to stand. Having obeyed this order, the rope was
adjusted around his neck. The assistant magistrate
then called out to him in Hindostanee, "Have you
anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib," was the reply. And he began a long
story, false from beginning to end, but every word
of which the Bengalee writer took down. He spoke,
and with vehemence, for about thirty-five minutes,
when, having stopped, either finally, or to take
breath, the assistant magistrate gave the signal to the
gaoler, by waving his hand. The crock was then
pulled from under the culprit by the two policemen,
and down dangled the culprit's body, the feet not
more than eighteen inches from the ground.</p>

<p>They are not adepts in the art of hanging in
India; it took the culprit at least ten minutes to die.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
At times I feared, so desperate were his struggles,
that he would break the beam, snap the rope, or
bring down the whole apparatus. In the days of
Henry Fielding, the vulgar used to speak of hanging
as "dancing on nothing," and this horrible idea the
Indian culprit on that morning amply realised. The
reader must not, however, sympathize with his sufferings.
He had been justly convicted, and was justly
put to death for murdering, in that very field where
he expiated his offence, a little girl of seven years of
age, in order to possess himself of a single bangle
she wore&mdash;a bangle valued at one rupee four annas&mdash;half-a-crown
of English money. I cannot accuse
myself of a cruel or brutal disposition; but, if the
monster whom I saw hanged had had a thousand
lives instead of one, I could have witnessed the
taking of every one of them without a single atom
of a desire to save him.</p>

<p>The cutting down of the culprit, as soon as it was
discovered that life was extinct (for as there was
no crowd of pickpockets and vendors of cakes and
ginger-beer to take a moral lesson, the prescribed
hour was unnecessary) was quite as primitive as the
foregoing part of the operation. One of the native
policemen with his blunt sword, severed the rope by
sawing it just above the tie, and down came the
corpse. I was tempted to jump out of the buggy
in which, sitting between the magistrate and his
assistant, I had witnessed the execution, and examine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
or rather look attentively at, the deceased. A finer
head, in a phrenological point of view, I had never
seen, and across the naked chest was suspended the
sacred thread, indicating that the culprit was a
Brahmin.</p>

<p>"Is it not very odd," said I, on my return to the
buggy, "that most of the diabolical crimes committed
in this country are committed by Brahmins?"</p>

<p>"Not at all odd," replied my host. "Do you not
know that they believe nothing can hurt their pure
souls after death; and hence their comparative recklessness
in this world? There was a Brahmin hanged
here, about a year ago, who, just before he was turned
off, made a speech such as that made by Napoleon
on paper to Sir Hudson Lowe&mdash;'You may convict
me of what you please; you may make me a prisoner;
you may, if you like, shackle these limbs, and
consign me to a dungeon; but you will find that my
soul will be just as free, just as proud, as when it
awed all Europe!'"</p>

<p>"Ah, but that was the emanation of &mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What the deuce is that?" cried the magistrate,
who was driving us rapidly towards home. "See!
That thing in the road." And coming up to it, he
reined in the horse.</p>

<p>The syce (groom), who was running behind the
buggy, picked up the object, at his master's bidding.
It was a cloak&mdash;a lady's cloak&mdash;made of most costly
materials&mdash;satin and silk, and wadded throughout. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
had evidently fallen, unobserved, from some palanquin
during the night, and an examination of the footprints
showed that the last traveller who had moved
along the road was journeying upward, and was then
most probably staying at the d√¢k bungalow, at Deobund,
a halting-place some twelve miles distant. The
assistant magistrate, after we had breakfasted, proposed
that he and I should drive to Deobund, and
make inquiries. I was nothing loth, and a swift
mare having been harnessed and put to the buggy,
off we started, two sowars (native horsemen or
mounted police) cantering behind us.</p>

<p>About two miles from the bungalow to which we
were proceeding, we overtook a tribe of large monkeys.
I should say there were as many as four hundred,
and each carried a stick of uniform length and shape.
They, moved along in ranks or companies, just, in
short, as though they were imitating a wing of a
regiment of infantry. At the head of this tribe was
an old and very powerful monkey, who was no doubt
the chief. It was a very odd sight, and I became
greatly interested in the movements of the creatures.
There could be no question that they had either some
business or some pleasure on hand, and the fact of
each carrying a stick led us to conclude that it
was the former upon which they were bent. Their
destination was, like ours, evidently Deobund, where
there are some hundreds of monkeys fed by a number
of Brahmins, who live near a Hindoo temple there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and perform religious ceremonies. They (this monkey
regiment) would not get out of the road on our
account, nor disturb themselves in any way, and my
friend was afraid to drive through their ranks, or
over any of them, for when assailed they are most
ferocious brutes, and armed as they were, and in
such numbers, they could have annihilated us with
the greatest ease. There was no help for us, therefore,
but to let the mare proceed at a walk in the
rear of the tribe, the members of which, now that we
were nearing Deobund, began to chatter frightfully.
Just before we came to the bungalow, they left the
road, and took the direction of the temple. Fain
would we have followed them; but to do so in the
buggy would have been impossible, for they crossed
over some very rough ground and two ditches. My
friend, therefore, requested the sowars to follow them,
and report all they might observe of their actions.
Meanwhile we moved off to the bungalow, in search
of the owner of the cloak. The first person whom
we saw was an ayah, who was sitting in the verandah,
playing with a child of about five years of age.</p>

<p>"Whose child is that?" asked the assistant-magistrate
of the ayah.</p>

<p>"The mem-Sahib's."</p>

<p>"What is the mem's name?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied, with a smile which
seemed to say that she was not warranted in being
communicative. While travelling, few servants who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
know their business will tell strangers the name of
their master or mistress.</p>

<p>"What is <i>your</i> name?" he then inquired of the
boy, in English.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," was the reply, in Hindostanee,
accompanied by a shake of the head. It
is wonderful how rapidly the children of Europeans
in India take a cue from a native servant of either
sex. Not always, but in very many cases, it is in
deceit and falsehood that children are first schooled
by the servants. The reader must understand that
deceit and falsehood are not regarded as immoralities
in the eyes of Asiatics. A man or woman who, by
fraud and perjury wins a cause, or gains any other
point, is not looked down upon as a rogue, but up to
as a very clever fellow. Several other experiments were
made in order to extract from the ayah the name of
her mistress, but to no purpose. The only information
we could learn was, that the lady was much
fatigued, and was sleeping. We said nothing about
the cloak, by the way.</p>

<p>The servants of the bungalow, and at Deobund
(there were four of them) now came up to make
their most respectful salaam to one of the lords of
the district, the assistant-magistrate, on questioning
them in private as to the name of the lady,
we were in no way successful. All that the ayah
would tell them, they said, was, that she had come
from Calcutta, and was going to Simlah. "She is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
burra beebee, however, Sahib," added the Khansamah;
"for all along the road, after she left the
steamer at Allahabad, until she arrived at Meerut,
she was escorted by two sowars; and when she reaches
the Saharunpore bungalow, she will find sowars ready.
This is the only district in which she has had no
escort."</p>

<p>This was a mystery that my friend could not unravel:
why, if other magistrates had been indented
upon (as magistrates very frequently were, when
ladies were nervous and travelling with only an ayah),
he should be omitted; especially as his district was
as dangerous to pass through as any other (not that
there was much or any danger in those days), was
more than he could understand; and he very naturally
became all the more curious (apart from the
ownership of the cloak) to know the name of the lady
who had broken the link of her escort when she came
into his district. "Perhaps," said he to me, "either
I have or my chief has given her husband some offence,
and, possibly, he is small-minded enough to decline
asking me to do what after all is only a matter of
duty, or of civility and compliment, which amounts
to pretty much the same thing. However, we shall
see."</p>

<p>My friend now mentioned to the Khansamah, a
very old but very active and intelligent man, the
sight we had seen on the road&mdash;the regiment of
monkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed the old man, "it is about the
time."</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"Well, Sahib, about every five years that tribe
comes up the country to pay a visit to this place; and
another tribe comes about the same time from the up-country&mdash;the
hills. They meet in a jungle behind
the old Hindoo temple, and there embrace each other
as though they were human beings and old friends
who had been parted for a length of time. I have
seen in that jungle as many as four or five thousand.
The Brahmins say that one large tribe comes all the
way from Ajmere, and another from the southern side
of the country, and from Nepal and Tirhoot. There
were hundreds of monkeys here this morning, but now
I do not see one. I suppose they have gone to welcome
their friends."</p>

<p>The sowars who had been deputed to follow the
tribe now rode up, and reported that in the vicinity of
the old temple there was an army of apes&mdash;an army
of forty thousand! One of the sowars, in the true
spirit of Oriental exaggeration, expressed himself to
the effect that it would be easier to count the hairs of
one's head than the number there assembled.</p>

<p>"Let us go and look at them," I suggested, "and
by the time we return the lady may be stirring."</p>

<p>"But we will not go on foot," said my friend; "we
will ride the sowars' horses. In the first place, I have
an instinctive horror of apes, and should like to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the means of getting away from them speedily, if they
became too familiar or offensive. In the second place,
I do not wish to fatigue myself by taking so long a
walk in the heat of the day."</p>

<p>We mounted the horses, and were soon at the spot
indicated by the sowars. There were not so many as
had been represented; but I am speaking very far
within bounds when I state that there could not have
been fewer than eight thousand, and some of them of
an enormous size. I could scarcely have believed
that there were so many monkeys in the world if I
had not visited Benares, and heard of the tribes at
Gibraltar. Their sticks, which were thrown together
in a heap, formed a very large stack of wood.</p>

<p>"What is this?" my friend said to one of the Brahmins;
for since his appointment he had never heard
of this gathering of apes.</p>

<p>"It is a festival of theirs, Sahib," was the reply.
"Just as Hindoos at stated times go to Hurdwar,
Hajipore, and other places, so do these monkeys come
to this holy place."</p>

<p>"And how long do they stay?"</p>

<p>"Two or three days; then they go away to their
homes in different parts of the country; then attend
to their business for four or five years; then come
again and do festival, and so on, sir, to the end of
all time. You see that very tall monkey there,
with two smaller ones on either side of him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, sir, that is a very old monkey. His age
is more than twenty years, I think. I first saw him
fifteen years ago. He was then full-grown. His
native place is Meerut. He lives with the Brahmins
at the Soorj Khan, near Meerut. The smaller ones
are his sons, sir. They have never been here before;
and you see he is showing them all about the place,
like a very good father."</p>

<p>Having seen enough of these "sacred animals," we
returned to the bungalow; we were only just in time,
for the lady was about to depart, albeit the sun was
very high in the heavens, and the day, for the time
of year, was extremely hot. We caught sight of her
in the verandah. My friend became deadly pale, and
exclaimed: "Is it possible!"</p>

<p>"What?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"I will tell you on our way home. I must see her&mdash;speak
to her&mdash;painful as our meeting must be.
Only fancy, if that cloak should be hers!"</p>

<p>The lady, who must have learnt from the servants
at the bungalow the name of my friend, the official,
evidently desired to avoid an interview with him; for
upon our approach she retired from the palanquin,
which she was arranging, and entered hastily the
room she had occupied. We (my friend and myself)
went into the other room of the bungalow, which
happened to be vacant. Presently we heard the voice
of the ayah. She was very angry and was accusing
the servants of the bungalow of being thieves. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had now, for the first time since they were lost, missed
several articles, and amongst them the cloak of her
mistress. She was perfectly ready to swear that she
had seen them all since their arrival at the bungalow;
that she had removed them from the palkees with her
own hands; and if the servants had not stolen them
who had?&mdash;who could have done so? Distinctly did
we hear the lady command the ayah to be silent&mdash;to
say nothing of the loss, and enter her palanquin; but
the ayah, too much enraged to hear or to heed the
command, repeated her accusation; whereupon the
servants in a body rushed into the apartment in which
we were standing listening, and after protesting their
perfect innocence of the theft, referred to the character
for honesty which every one of them had borne
for many years. Strange to say, frequent as are the
opportunities which the servants at these bungalows
have of pilfering from travellers, they rarely or never
avail themselves of such opportunities; and, whenever
it has happened that a lady or gentleman has died in
one of them, the money and effects have always been
forthcoming, with nothing whatever missing.</p>

<p>The lady now forced the ayah to depart, and enter
her palanquin, in which the little boy was sitting; she
was about to follow, when my friend rushed into the
verandah, and, seizing her by the hand, detained her.
She was as agitated as he was; and quite as pale.
He held her hand in his with a firm but withal a
gentle grasp, and looked into her face, which must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
have been beautiful when she was a few years younger.
As it was, she had still a charming profile and countenance,
and a skin as white as snow. From the
window, or rather looking through the Venetians, I
beheld the scene, which reminded me of that exquisite
picture of Mr. Frank Stone&mdash;<i>The Last Appeal</i>.
There was a look of agony and despair in the face of
the man; while the woman, who appeared to sympathise
with his sufferings, did not for awhile raise her
eyes from the ground. But at length she did so, and,
looking mournfully into my friend's face for a few
seconds, burst into tears, and presently her head, involuntarily
as it were, rested on his shoulder. Suddenly
recollecting herself, she again attempted to take
her departure; but my friend, now grown desperate
seemingly, placed her arm beneath his, and walked
with her to a clump of shade-giving mango trees, in
front of the bungalow, and there they held a conversation
which lasted some ten minutes. The lady then
tore herself away from my friend, and after bidding
him farewell, she threw herself into her palanquin,
which was speedily lifted by the bearers and borne
away, followed by the two sowars, who were commanded
to escort the fair traveller to the next station.
My friend, from the verandah of the bungalow, watched
the procession till it was out of sight, and then, seating
himself on the steps, covered his face with his
hands, and wept like a child.</p>

<p>"Come!" I said, after a time, laying a hand on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
his shoulder. "I am not very impatient to know
your secret, but it is time that we thought of returning.
What about the cloak? You have not restored
it to the owner."</p>

<p>"No, my dear fellow, and I never intend to do so.
She has consented to my retaining it. That cloak
has warmed her dear limbs, and the sight of it shall
warm my heart till the last hour of my existence."</p>

<p>On the way home my friend (who was accidentally
drowned in the river Jumna, about two years ago)
spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Ten years have now elapsed since that lady and I
were fellow-passengers on board of a ship bound from
London to Calcutta. She was then seventeen years
of age, and I twenty. On the voyage we became
very much attached to each other, and eventually
loved each other devotedly. And, what was more,
we were betrothed. It was arranged that as soon as
practicable we should be married, I was compelled,
on arrival, to remain at the college at Fort William for
a year, to pass an examination; she was obliged to
proceed to a large station in Bengal, to join her family.
Her father was a member of the civil service; previous
to her arrival he had promised Alice (that is her name)
to an old man, a judge, who had been twice married,
and who was then a widower. This old man was very
rich, and had&mdash;as he still has&mdash;a great influence with
the government. A brother of his was one of the
lords of Leadenhall-street, and of this country. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
some time after our unhappy separation we corresponded
regularly; but suddenly the correspondence
ceased. Her letters to me, and mine to her, were intercepted.
Meanwhile, the old judge, to whom she had
been promised, paid his addresses to her. She refused
him. Many devices were resorted to in order to
wean her affections from me. They all failed. At length
they hit upon one which had the desired effect. They
caused a paragraph to be inserted in one of the Calcutta
journals, to the effect that I had married the
daughter of a half-caste merchant. Alice was permitted
to see this paper, but none of those containing
my indignant denial of the truth of the announcement.</p>

<p>"In disgust at my imagined faithlessness, and in
despair and recklessness, Alice at length accepted the
hand of the old judge. They were married. When
made acquainted with this horrible fact, I became
half-mad. I drank very hard, had an attack of <i>delirium
tremens</i>, and was sent home for change of air
and scene, to recruit my health. On my return to
India, after an absence of eighteen months, I was sent
to Dacca, where there was not the slightest chance of
my ever seeing Alice. Subsequently, I was, at my
own request, transferred to these provinces, but sent
to Banda&mdash;a sort of penal settlement for refractory
civilians; not that I ever committed any offence beyond
that of loving Alice and being beloved by her.
You must understand that, owing to the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
his brother, her old husband, shortly after his marriage
with Alice, became the great man he now is;
and he had only to express a wish in this country,
touching the appointment or <i>dis</i>appointment of any
junior in the service, to have such wish instantly
realised. My only surprise is, that when it became
necessary for her to pass through this district, I was
not ordered away to Scinde, on some trumpery business,
alleged to be special. Had there been any idea
that we should meet&mdash;as by the merest chance we
have met&mdash;again in this world, I should certainly
have been removed, and ordered to some other station
miles away. I have never seen her since we parted
in Calcutta, now more than nine years ago, until this
very day. But, thank Heaven! she loves me still!"</p>

<p>"I was afraid, when I saw you talking to her beneath
that clump of trees, that&mdash;&mdash;" I was about to
make some observations.</p>

<p>"Ah, no!" he interrupted me. "There is no
danger. Great and lasting as my love for her is, I
could not bear the thought of taking the slightest advantage
of her feelings; or to see her fall from the
sphere in which she holds a lofty and proud position.
She is not happy, neither am I. But spirits will recognise
each other, and be united for ever and ever.
Ours is not a solitary case; sometimes when ladies in
India fall they deserve far more of pity than of
blame."</p>

<h2>THE HIMALAYAS.</h2>


<p>I have already spoken of a German Baron and a
French gentleman whom I met at Agra, and I have
said that they, like myself, were travelling in search
of the picturesque, and with a view to become
acquainted with Oriental character from personal
observation.</p>

<p>While staying with my friend at Barnapore, I received
a letter from the former, proposing that we
should meet on a certain day at Mussoorie, in the
Himalaya mountains, and travel into the interior
together. I agreed with all my heart; and my
friend, the assistant magistrate, was tempted to apply
for six weeks' leave, in order that he might accompany
us.</p>

<p>Let me describe these foreign gentlemen. They
were respectively about my own age&mdash;thirty-two&mdash;had
seen a great deal of the world, and of the society
at every court and capital in Europe. They were
both possessed of considerable abilities, and of the
most enviable dispositions; always good-natured and
good-tempered; patient and cheerful under those
innumerable little difficulties that almost invariably
beset a wanderer in the East, or, in fact, a wanderer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in any part of the world. They had, moreover, a keen
sense of humour; and, each in his own peculiar way,
could relate a story, or an incident in his life, in such
a manner as to make it wonderfully mirth-provoking.
They were men of refined understanding and of very
refined manners: take them all in all, they were the
most charming companions I ever encountered. They
were utterly devoid of vulgar nationalities&mdash;of any
enthusiastic admiration of their own fatherlands, and
would just as soon ridicule the foibles peculiar to
their own countries, respectively, as the foibles of a
man of any other country. My friend the assistant
magistrate was also a desirable companion. He, too,
was a good-tempered, good-humoured being, with a
keen sense of humour, and some wit. He had read
a great deal of late years, in that out-of-the-way
station to which he had been appointed, and he had
profited by his reading.</p>

<p>It was beginning to be very hot in the plains, and
my friend and myself were not a little glad when we
found ourselves on the road to a colder clime. We
drove as far as Deobund in the buggy; and, at three
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> threw ourselves into our palanquins (palkees),
bound for Dehra Dhoon at the foot of the hills; at
which place we arrived at about nine o'clock on the
following morning, and were deposited&mdash;both of us
fast asleep&mdash;in the verandah of the hotel, kept by a
Mr. William Johns, who had been formerly a professional
jockey in the North-West Provinces of India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>So much has been written of Dehra Dhoon and
Mussoorie, that even a brief sketch of these places
would be unwarranted in this narrative.</p>

<p>As soon as we arrived at Mussoorie we began to
collect coolies (hill-men), to carry our baggage and
stores. We required in all about one hundred and
fifty for the expedition, and by the time that we had
got these people together, and made arrangements
with them, and the guides whom we required, and
had laid in our stock of provisions, &amp;c., the foreign
gentlemen joined us, and expressed their readiness to
start at any given moment. We lingered, however,
for two days, in order that they might take some rest,
and make the acquaintance of the gentlemen at the
club, who, at the instance of my friend, had made them
as well as myself honorary members of the institution.</p>

<p>On the third morning, in the front of the club-house,
our marching establishment was collected, and
the one hundred and fifty men of whom it was composed
were laden with the baggage and stores.
There were tents, the poles thereto belonging, camp
tables, chairs, beds, bedding, leather boxes of every
kind, containing our clothing, &amp;c., deal chests, containing
all sorts of provisions, dozens of cases of wine&mdash;port,
sherry, claret&mdash;beer, ducks, fowls, geese, guns
(rifles and others), umbrellas, great-coats, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.
Having seen this train fairly off, we, the four of us,
followed shortly after on foot, and overtook them at
the Landour Hill, a mountain about nine thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
feet above the level of the sea. We were all in high
spirits&mdash;including my friend the assistant magistrate&mdash;notwithstanding
he put on his lady love's cloak as
soon as we were out of sight of the club, and began
to quote in a melancholy but very loud voice, which
reverberated through the valleys on either side of us,
those glorious lines of the poet Thomson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"There is a power</span><br />
Unseen, that rules th' illimitable world&mdash;<br />
That guides its motions, from the brightest<br />
Star to least dust of this sin-tainted mould;<br />
While man, who madly deems himself the lord<br />
Of all, is nought but weakness and dependence.<br />
This sacred truth, by sure experience taught,<br />
Thou must have learnt, when wandering all alone:<br />
Each bird, each insect flitting through the sky,<br />
Was more sufficient for itself than <i>thou</i>!"<br />
</div>

<p>Our first halting-place was about nine miles from
Mussoorie. It was a flat piece of ground, some distance
down the southern face of the peak over which
the road wound. The place was called Sowcowlee,
and here and there were to be seen a few patches of
cultivation and a cowshed. Our course lay in the
direction of Almorah, another Hill Sanatarium for
the English in India. The tents pitched, and all
made snug and comfortable, we threw ourselves down
upon our beds, not to sleep, but to take some rest
after a long walk. Meanwhile our servants busied
themselves in preparing the dinner, for which the
exercise and the change of air had given us all a keen
appetite.</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed my friend (whom in future we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
will call Mr. West), raising to his lips a bumper of
claret, and quoting from the Sentimental Journey,
"the Bourbon is not such a bad fellow, after all."</p>

<p>Neither the Frenchman nor the German understood
the allusion; but when it was explained they
relished it amazingly. We were rather a temperate
party; and after the second bottle of wine was
emptied, we caused the glasses to be removed from
our small table, and a green cloth spread over it.
We then began to play at whist&mdash;a game of which
we were all equally fond; and, what was of great
consequence, we were all equal as players. We did
not gamble exactly; but the stakes were sufficiently
high to make either side attend very carefully to the
game. The whist over, we each took a tumbler of
warm drink, and turned in for the night, and slept, as
the reader may imagine, very soundly.</p>

<p>On the following morning, at sunrise, we were
awakened, and informed that upon a hill opposite to
our encampment there were several large deer.
We arose, and went in pursuit of them. After
dodging them for some time we came within range,
and each of us, selecting his animal, fired. One
shot only took effect, and that was from the Baron's
rifle. During our ramble we discovered that there
were plenty of pheasants in the locality, and so we
agreed to remain for the day, and, after breakfast, see
what we could do amongst them. Under the circumstances
we should have been compelled to halt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for, as is usual on such occasions, our servants had
forgotten several little matters essential for our comfort,
if not necessary for our journey, namely, the
pickles and the sauces, the corkscrew, the instrument
for opening the hermetically sealed tins containing
lobsters, oysters, and preserved soups. Amongst
other things that had been left behind was the Baron's
guitar, and without it he could not, or would not, sing
any of his thousand and one famous German songs.
And such a sweet voice as he had! So, while we were
amongst the pheasants, five coolies were on their way
back to Mussoorie, to bring up the missing articles
above enumerated.</p>

<p>By two o'clock, we had bagged eleven noble birds,
and returned to our encampment, sufficiently hungry
to enjoy the refreshments which the Khansamah (butler),
who was a great artist in his way, had prepared
for us. Our repast concluded, we had our camp bedsteads
brought into the open air, and threw ourselves
down on them.</p>

<p>Holding his cigar between the thumb and forefinger
of his left hand, the Baron thus went off:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who can explain the inscrutable mystery of presentiments?
Who can fathom the secret inclinations
of the human heart? Who can lift the veil of
sympathy? Who can unravel the web of magnetic
natures? Who can fully comprehend that
link which unites the corporeal with the spiritual
world? Who can explain that terrible symbol which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
pervades so many of our dreams? The sweet anxiety
that seizes us when listening to some wonderful tale;
the voluptuous shiver which agitates our frame, the
indefinite yearning which fills the heart and the soul.
All this is a guarantee that some invisible chain links
our world with another. Let no one condemn as idle
nonsense that which our shallow reason may refuse
to accept. Can the most acute understanding explain,
or even comprehend, its own growth; or even
the growth and colouring of a mere flower? Is not
Nature herself a perfect mystery unto the minds of
thinking men?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Baron?" asked the Frenchman.
"Have you a nightmare in this broad daylight?"</p>

<p>"No, no," returned the Baron, with good-natured
impetuosity. "It is not so. I wish to tell you something&mdash;a
little story, if you will listen."</p>

<p>"Pray go on," we (his three companions) cried out,
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Some ten or twelve years ago," the Baron proceeded,
"I was travelling from Munich to Berlin.
Tired by the continual rumbling of my carriage, I
resolved upon taking a day's rest at Augsburg. It
was the day of All Souls. The autumnal sun was
shining brightly, and a large procession went its way
towards the cemetery, a mile distant from the town.
Wherefore, I know not; but I was instinctively led
to join this procession. On arriving at the cemetery
we found it, comparatively, crowded. All the graves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
were decked with flowers and sprigs of young cypress,
and near every stone there sat or knelt, at least, one
mourner. Tears of love and regret wetted the sacred
earth. In a singularly agitated frame of mind, I
wandered through the cemetery. The recollection of
departed friends, and of dear ones far away, made me
sad, unhappy, miserable. And I could not help
thinking that if I had been then entombed, no
friendly hand would on that day have deposited a
wreath or a flower upon my grave, no beloved eye
shed a tear of sorrow, no faithful heart sent up to
Heaven a fervent prayer for the eternal rest of my
soul. Haunted by such gloomy thoughts, I wandered
on, and at last came to a newly-made grave. An
hour previously had been buried in that spot a young
girl of seventeen years of age. The parents and the
lover of the girl stood weeping near her grave, and
her young friends adorned the mound with freshly
gathered flowers. In a fit of profound melancholy, I
bent down, mechanically picked up a half-opened
rose-bud, and walked on. Approaching the gate of
the cemetery, with the intention of returning to my
hotel, my eyes fell upon a tablet upon which were
engraved the following words:&mdash;'Respect the property
of the Dead. Flowers are the property of the
Dead.' These simple words made a very great impression
on my already excited mind: and glancing,
involuntarily, at the rose-bud which I still held in
my hand, my heart smote me for having carried it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
away from the girl's grave. I was on the point of
returning to re-deposit the flower, when an indescribably
false shame prevented my doing so, and I left
the cemetery with the rose in my hand. On returning
to my hotel, I put it in a glass of water, and
placed it on a small table near the head of my bed,
upon which I threw myself, and soon fell into that
state which all of you must have experienced: a state
in which the senses hover between sleep and wakefulness,
as though undecided which to choose. Suddenly
my apartment was filled by a bright but
soft light, without my being able to perceive whence
it came. Be it known that I had extinguished my
candle. Ere long, the door of my room was opened;
and in glided, noiselessly, a pale spectral figure, clad
in a white robe, and wearing a garland of flowers. It
was the figure of a young girl, and the face was
angelic. With motionless eyes and outstretched
hand she approached my couch, and in plaintive
voice asked me: 'Why hast thou robbed the Dead?
Why hast thou taken that flower which a faithful
lover threw upon my last resting-place on earth?'
Seemingly my pulses ceased to beat, and I could
scarcely breathe. The phantom then stretched forth
the left hand, and took the rose out of the glass; and
with the right hand she beckoned to me, saying:
'Come! Come, and give back the property of the
Dead. Respect the property of the Dead. Come!
Follow me!' In vain I tried to resist. I arose, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
followed the figure out of the room and into the deserted
streets. It was not dark; for the moon was
at her full and shining brightly. Onward stalked the
figure, I followed her towards the cemetery. We
arrived at the gate. She touched it. It opened
noiselessly. We entered. She led me to the grave&mdash;the
grave from which I had taken the flower.
With trembling hand I received from hers the rose,
and placed it on the very spot whence I had removed
it. And then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the Baron paused&mdash;and relighted his cigar.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and then?" we all asked.</p>

<p>"Then," replied the Baron, "I awoke&mdash;that is to
say, if I had ever been asleep. And looking in the
tumbler in which I had placed the rose, I discovered
that it was gone."</p>

<p>"The chambermaid, possibly; or the waiter, who
may have entered your apartment for orders, may
have seen, admired, and carried it away while you
were slumbering," suggested the lively Frenchman;
"and a very lucky fellow you were, not to have missed
your watch and your purse at the same time and
place."</p>

<p>"No," said the Baron, shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Mr. West, "you had taken more
wine than usual?"</p>

<p>"No," was the reply. "The truth is that the story
I have related to you was written by that great Austrian
wit and satirist, Saphir. It was one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
earlier compositions, which, strange to say, were all
of a very melancholy cast. Saphir, however, to this
day asserts that his story of 'The Death Rose' is a
fact, and that it happened to himself."</p>

<p>One by one, we dropped off to sleep, and slept for
about an hour and a-half. On awakening, the Frenchman,
West, and myself, almost simultaneously exclaimed,
"Confound your Death Rose, Baron!" for
the truth was that the story had taken possession of
our senses, while we were asleep.</p>

<p>"I thought it would," said the Baron laughing.
"Everybody dreams of the Death Rose after I have
told the story. But, ah! See in the distance!
Here are the coolies returning! I can make out my
guitar-box on the head of one man. Ah! to-night we
will sing plenty of songs!"</p>

<p>And in the evening the Baron sang for several hours
(we could have listened to him all night) some of the
most sentimental, and some of the most humorous
songs that I had ever heard. Fortunately I knew
enough of German to appreciate them; and my friend,
Mr. West, was equally fortunate. As for the Frenchman
he understood and spoke&mdash;albeit very imperfectly&mdash;every
language current in Europe. On that
night we retired before twelve, for we had agreed to
rise and proceed early on the morrow.</p>

<p>In pursuance of such agreement, as soon as the day
dawned we struck our tents, packed up our traps,
loaded the coolies, and set out for a place called Demooltee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
distant some fourteen or fifteen miles. The
road, which had been very, very seldom travelled over
by Europeans, was a narrow and bad road, winding
round and leading over lofty peaks, some ten or eleven
thousand feet above the level of the sea. Above us
and below us we frequently saw herds of Ghooral and
other deer; but as we could not, or would not rather,
have stayed to pick up any that we might kill, we
suffered them to graze on, and preserved our ammunition.
By the way we saw an animal which none of
as had ever seen before&mdash;an animal called the Seron.
It is a species of chamois, but larger and stronger.
Its colour was reddish, and it had a quantity of stiff,
short hair on the neck, which gave it the appearance
of a hogged mane. The native guides told us that it
was a very shy animal, and only to be found where
there was a great quantity of wood. The scenery of
this part, in March, was exceedingly beautiful and
varied. At times we had a good view of Mussoorie
and the surrounding country. At other times we
moved through vast forests of pine, and woods of oak,
rhododendron, and other magnificent trees. In the
midst of one of these woods our halting-place was
situated, a large grassy flat, bounded on either side by
a deep and steep precipice, while in every direction
the surrounding mountains, which locked us in, were
covered thickly with trees.</p>

<p>"What fools men are," exclaimed the Baron, whilst
the servants were unpacking, "to huddle themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
together in old countries when lands like these remain
uncultivated and unenjoyed! And what fools are
those travellers who go, year after year, gazing on
comparatively paltry mountains and lakes which the
eyes of the vulgar of all nations have beheld, when
such fresh and gorgeous scenery as this may be looked
at! Travelling in Switzerland and Italy&mdash;bah!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Baron," said the Frenchman, "you
forget that the Peninsular and Oriental Company demand
four pounds a day for conveying you from England
to India, in consequence, they say, of the dearness
of coals."</p>

<p>"Ah! well," laughed the Baron, opening with his
own hand a bottle of hock, and emptying the contents
into a silver tankard, "if you regard the matter in an
economical point of view, you at once cut short my
argument and my sentiment. Egad! what grapes
could be grown on yonder hill, in that warm valley!
What wine could be grown there! I will come out
to this country with a few German peasants. I will
have vineyards. I will make a fortune so colossal
that Rothschild, when he is in difficulties, will have to
write to me. Yes, I will. The thing is to be done,
and I will do it."</p>

<p>"But you forget," said Mr. West, "that you are
now some twelve or thirteen hundred miles from the
nearest sea-port, Calcutta, and that there would be
some little difficulty in transmitting the produce to
Europe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Europe! Europe! Why do you talk of Europe?
Does not British India contain enough of Europeans
to make a market? This bottle of good wine which
we are going to drink costs twelve shillings in this
country. I could grow it, make it, and sell it for one
shilling a bottle! Ah! you may laugh; but I tell
you this is the fact. I am a proprietor of vineyards,
and do not speak at random like a schoolboy, or an
enthusiast. The natives of the country would soon
learn that art&mdash;for an art it is&mdash;of wine-making; and,
as for the soil, it is superb. Yes! Grow wine, which
would do your soldiers good. Generous wine, instead
of that blood-drying, brain-consuming, soul-destroying
arrack&mdash;your horrible grogs, and your bile-making
beers."</p>

<p>"But we have no roads, Baron."</p>

<p>"True! But is there a scarcity of labour in India?
Are pickaxes, shovels, spades, saws, and gunpowder to
blast rocks, so expensive that a government cannot
procure them? Roads! My good sir, only a few
years ago there was no road over the Spl√ºgen! The
time was when you had no road from Calcutta to
Benares. You have no roads! Well, make them.
The wine and the tea that you grow will more than
pay for them, as well as remunerate the growers."</p>

<p>"The tea?" asked Mr. West.</p>

<p>"Yes, the tea, I said!" returned the Baron. "You
have discovered that you can grow tea in the lower
range of these mountains, and you do grow it in small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
quantities; now why not, having made the experiment,
grow it in <i>large</i> quantities? I would say to
Mr. Chinaman, 'I thank you very much, but I do not
want any more of your tea. You are insolent, overbearing,
and insulting in your dealings with me, and
now you may drink your own tea, and I will drink
<i>my</i> own tea; and, if you like, you may stir yours with
your own pigtail. We will bring China into our own
dominions, for God has given to this climate and to
this soil the same properties as your soil and climate
possess.' I do not say it, as you know, with any sort
of intention to offend, but the result of my experience
leads me to believe that the government of this
country is, in all matters (save annexation), as slow
as the government of the Dutch was in by-gone days.
There is a listlessness and a languor about its movements;
a want of everything in the shape of society
and enterprise, and seemingly such an earnest desire
to discourage the efforts of those who would in reality
develop the resources of India, that I am astonished
any man unconnected with the services should persevere
in the attempt to make a living in the Eastern
British dominions."</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said Mr. West, "especially
as regards that portion of your remarks which
relates to the obstacles thrown in the way of enterprising
Englishmen. I have been a member of the
Civil Service for nearly ten years, and have always
been impressed with the idea that the policy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
government in respect to settlers in India, was and is
a very erroneous policy."</p>

<p>The conversation here was brought abruptly to a
close by the approach of one of the guides, who, in a
very confidential manner, imparted to us that there
was a kakur (a barking deer) grazing on a crag not
far from the encampment. So we seized our guns,
went in pursuit, and were fortunate enough to kill
the animal. His bark resembles exactly that of a
Skye-terrier when very much excited. On our return
to the encampment we encountered a huge bear,
and succeeded in killing and carrying him to the
door of our tent, where the natives skinned him and
deprived him of his fat, which they boiled down and
used in the lamps instead of oil. And very brightly
did it burn; but the aroma was not a peculiarly pleasant
one. I am afraid to say how much grease was
taken from this enormous bear; but I know that I
am speaking within bounds when I assert it was in
excess of two gallons and a half.</p>

<p>We dined at dusk, and then, as usual, betook ourselves
to whist, but so cold did it become shortly after
dark, that we were forced to put on our great coats,
notwithstanding there was an enormous wood fire in
front and at the back of our tent. These fires had
been lighted to serve another purpose beyond that of
giving warmth&mdash;namely, to scare away the leopards
which abounded in that locality. It was a very picturesque
scene; the white tents standing out in relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
from the dark wood, lighted up by the fires, and here
and there groups of coolies wrapped up in blankets,
and sitting as closely as possible to the blaze.</p>

<p>At daylight on the following morning our march
was recommenced. We had a distance of ten miles
to travel before we could reach the next halting-place,
named Kanah Tall. During this march we did not
go out of our way for game, but only took such as
chanced to cross our path. All we killed was ghooral,
(which we did not stop to look at even) and two braces
of partridges of very peculiar plumage. They were
remarkably handsome birds, with a red mark round
the eye and down each side of the neck, olive-coloured
feathers on their backs, and their wings and breasts
covered with white and red spots. We could not fail
to admire the beauty of the flowers which flourished
in this locality. The ground on either side of the narrow
and wild road was literally covered with violets,
dog-roses, and a lily of the valley, and other little decorations
of the earth, of which I know not the name.
Throughout the whole march the scene was truly
fairy-like. Kanah Tall was only five thousand feet
above the level of the sea, and therefore very much
warmer than our last halting-place. Of this we were
by no means sorry, not only for our own sakes, but
for the sakes of our personal servants, who had never
before travelled out of the plains. Here, at Kanah
Tall, we found the English holly growing. Botanists
may tell me what they please about this holly of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Himalayas bearing a distinctive character; but I say
it was the English holly&mdash;the same sort of holly that
I saw last Christmas in almost every house in London
and in the country.</p>

<p>Here, at Kanah Tall, we shot no less than seven
elks. These deer are very plentiful hereabouts, and
do a great deal of damage to the crops of the poor
villagers at harvest time. Ghooral and kakur also
abound here. We were so tired on the evening that
we stopped at Kanah Tall that we could not sit up to
play at whist! We actually fell asleep over our second
rubber, and by general consent threw our cards upon
the table and sought our beds.</p>

<p>The next day, at three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, we arrived at a place
called Jullinghee, ten miles distant from Kanah Tall.
Jullinghee is a large village situated on the right bank
of the Bhagaruttee, a stream that flows direct from
Gungootrie, and is in consequence one of the most
sacred streams that compose the mighty and holy
Ganges. We were encamped beneath a clump of apricot
and walnut trees, but it was frightfully hot; for we
were now not more than a couple of thousand feet
above the level of the sea. The woods, however, were
exceedingly beautiful and diversified. Not only were
there apricot, walnut, rhododendrons, oaks, hollies,
and other trees of the higher altitudes, but also the
tamarind, the fig-peepul, the pomegranate, and others
of the plains. At this village we procured some honey,
which is taken from its makers in a very singular manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
The bees build in cavities in the walls of the
houses, which are closed within by a moveable board,
and are only entered by the bees, by a small aperture
from without. When the owners of the houses want
honey they darken the interior of the house, and removing
the board, which forms the back part of the
hive, extract as much as they require. The bees
during this process fly out into the light to discover
their enemies, who then close the back part of the
hive, and remain safely within doors until the wrath
of the bees has subsided.</p>

<p>In the evening we took a walk in the village of
Jullinghee, which appeared to be rich and populous,
but very dirty. Our arrival had caused a great stir,
and there was a large concourse of people near our
tents to look at us. A short distance from the village
were the ruins of several houses which once formed
a separate hamlet, but which had been deserted for
fear of a ghost which was said to haunt it. The same
effect of superstition is by no means uncommon in the
plains of India. There is a very curious instance in the
Meerut district. A village had long been deserted
under the idea that it was haunted by a fakir. The
settlement officer, however, with much difficulty prevailed
upon a neighbouring Zemindar to farm the land
at something like a nominal revenue. Shortly afterwards
the Zemindar presented himself to the settlement
officer, and represented that he had been very
ill, and that the visitation was ascribed by his friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
and by himself to his impiety in interfering with
haunted lands. The settlement officer, however,
talked to him and insisted on his keeping his engagements,
and once more did he venture to brave the
ghost. So complete was his success that the village
shortly became one of the most flourishing in the district,
and the very relatives who had been foremost in
reproaching the zemindar for his impiety, brought a
suit against him in one of the local courts, to recover
a share of his large profits!</p>

<p>On the day following we marched to a place called
Teree, a large straggling village, situated on a plain
of some extent, at the junction of the Billung and
Bhagaruttee rivers. A regular hot wind was blowing
here, and our tents were unbearable; so we threw
ourselves beneath the shade of a huge tree which
grew on the banks of the Billung, and which served
also as a shelter for a party from Srinugger, who were
celebrating the marriage festival of a Bunneah (corn-merchant)
of some twenty-two years of age, with a
young lady of eight. The little damsel was on the
ground, and did ample justice to the marriage dinner,
which consisted of rice, butter, sweetmeats, and a goat
roasted whole&mdash;a goat which had been decapitated by
one blow, and cooked without any sort of preparation
beyond the removal of the entrails; it was not even
skinned. Portions of this feast were distributed on
plantain leaves to each guest by the Brahmins, who
officiated as cooks and waiters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Teree is the residence of a Rajah, named Soodersain
Saha, whose family, before the Goorkha invasion,
ruled over the provinces of Gurhwal and Sirmoor, and
indeed over the whole hill country as far as Simlah,
and from the snowy range to the plains. Expelled by
the Goorkhas, he sought refuge with the British: and
after defeating the Goorkhas, was replaced by us in
the greater part of his territories; a part of them we
retained as the price of our assistance, namely, a portion
of Gurhwal, the whole of Dehra Dhoon, and a
part of the Terai. And we hold Landour and Mussoorie
from him at a nominal annual rent. The
Rajah is extremely civil to Europeans, and the moment
he heard of our arrival he sent a deputation to
wait upon us. The deputation brought with them a
variety of presents, consisting of milk, sweetmeats,
dried flour, dried fruits, and a couple of goats. The
deputation gave us to understand that it would afford
the Rajah very great pleasure to make our personal
acquaintance; and we were just on the point of starting
for his Highness's abode, when his arrival was unexpectedly
announced to us. At Srinugger, in a portion
of the country we took from him, is situated the
family palace, a handsome and substantial building.
This is rather a sore point with the old Rajah, and as
he considers the more modern abode which he now
inhabits beneath his dignity, he prefers going to see
any one with whom he is desirous of having an interview.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Having caused chairs to be placed in the front of
our tents, we advanced to meet the Rajah, who, dismounting
from a large Cabul horse, joined us, shook
hands with us very cordially, and remained with us
for upwards of an hour. He was a very small
and rather an old man; active and intelligent. He
talked to us about the Goorkha war, of which he had
been a spectator in the British camp; and he was
very eloquent on Punjab politics, and greatly praised
Lena Singh, whom he described as "very far in advance
of any of his countrymen in point of humanity,
civilization, and prudence." The little man told us,
amongst other things, that he was thinking of having
an iron suspension-bridge over the Bhagaruttee, but
that he could not find an engineer; and that his applications
to the Government, although he was ready
to defray every expense, had not met with any reply.
The present bridge is a sling or swing, and constructed
in the following manner. Two lines of coir rope,
each consisting of a number of smaller ropes, are suspended
from the rocks on either side of the stream,
and apart from each other about four feet. From
these ropes depend, at intervals of about two feet,
smaller lines or ropes about three or four feet deep.
These support slight wooden ladders, the ends of
which are lashed firmly to one another. The whole
affair has a very frail appearance, and at first it requires
no small amount of nerve to step from ring to
ring of the ladder, over that roaring torrent beneath.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Of course this bridge is only passable by men. Cattle
and mules swim across the river much higher up,
where the torrent is not so rapid.</p>

<p>We asked the Rajah where he had got his idea of
an iron suspension bridge, and he replied: "From a
picture-book which was given to me by a gentleman
who was out on a shooting excursion some years ago
in these hills."</p>

<p>We stayed two days at Teree, and, despite the heat,
enjoyed ourselves amazingly. Our next encampment
ground was at a place called Pon, a march of eleven
miles. Our route at first lay along the south bank of
the Billung river, and then up a deep glen at the foot
of a mountain, whose summit was some five thousand
feet above the level of the ocean. The monotony of
this day's journey was broken by meeting with
another marriage party, some of whom carried parasols
of evidently Chinese manufacture, and made out
of painted paper. We shot also several green pigeons&mdash;a
very different bird from the green pigeons of the
plains, and much better eating. By-the-by we also
met a pilgrim and his wife on their way to Gungootree,
the source of the Ganges: both of them were painted
and bedaubed after the most grotesque fashion. The
Frenchman took a sketch of this couple, and I have
heard that it now adorns an album in the possession
of the Empress of the French.</p>

<p>Our next march was to a place called Tekowlee,
where we halted beneath the shade of some large trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
and near the banks of a clear stream of water. On
one side of the stream there grew a quantity of wild
mint, some of which we gathered and cooled, preparatory
to using it for "cup." There is a moderate-sized
village near Tekowlee, and a Gosains' house or monastery,
which is inhabited by a large number of this
sect: we visited, and entered into conversation with
them. The building was composed of a large square
court-yard, surrounded by a range of two-storied barracks,
or rather cells, the lower story of which is protected
by a verandah. The place was full of men,
women, and children: the Gosains being the only
monastic order who are permitted by their tenets to
marry.</p>

<p>We had been out sixteen days before we reached
Loba, near to which place the Commissioner of Kumaon
resides during the rains and the autumn. His
bungalow is built upon the spur of a hill of considerable
length, and there is a good quantity of flat ground
in the vicinity. Not far from the bungalow is an old
fort, a Goorkha stronghold, which commanded the pass
leading to Almorah. It is chiefly celebrated, however,
as the place where Moorcroft and Hearsey were discovered
on their return from the Munsarowar lake,
whither they had gone disguised as Bairagis; and so
well had they sustained their characters, that they
would have returned undetected, had not a rumour
of their attempt reached the ears of the authorities
and excited their vigilance. They were harshly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
treated for some days, but eventually released on a
promise that they would return direct, and without
delay, to the British territories.</p>

<p>The Commissioner was not at the bungalow when
we arrived. Mr. West, however, knew him sufficiently
well to warrant our taking possession of it for the day.
After a residence for some time in tents, a house is a
very agreeable change.</p>

<p>On leaving Loba we came upon the Pilgrim road,
constructed by a former Commissioner of Kumaon to
facilitate the progress of the pilgrims to the sacred
places within the British Himalayas. It was a very
humane project, for many of the unfortunate pilgrims
used formerly&mdash;overcome by the difficulties of the
route&mdash;to lie down and perish by the way-side. Of
these pilgrims we met swarms&mdash;hundreds, if not
thousands&mdash;and with some we occasionally stopped
to converse.</p>

<p>Our encamping ground, at which we arrived at four
in the afternoon, was a short distance from a village
called Guniah. Our tents were pitched beneath a
clump of trees, and close to a clear stream called the
Ram Gunga, in which we caught a quantity of fish
with a casting-net. There are some mines between
Loba and Kumaon, but we did not go out of our way
to visit them. Here an accident happened to the
Baron. He sprained his ankle and could not walk;
so the next morning we put him into a Dandi, and
he was carried along the road by four of the coolies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
A Dandi is a pole, upon which is hung by its two
ends, which are gathered together, a piece of cloth or
canvas, open in the centre. This forms a hollow seat,
not a particularly comfortable one, until you get accustomed
to it, when the motion is rather pleasurable
than otherwise. During this day's march we shot a
quantity of black partridge, a hill fox, a deer, and a
wild dog of enormous size.</p>

<p>On the third day after leaving Loba we sighted our
(then) destination&mdash;the town of Almorah. On nearing
the place we came upon a hill to the right, which
bears the name of Brown's Hill; so called after an
officer of the 31st Native Infantry, who, in the Goorkha
war, volunteered to take it with his company,
though it had a stockade on the top which was obstinately
defended. And he did take it, after a very
severe loss. A monument is erected on this hill to
the memory of those who fell in the engagement. A
little further on is a large tree now used as a gallows.
This tree was the scene of a well-remembered occurrence,
just after the above-mentioned battle. A
Goorkha, shot through the leg, had fallen here. The
fighting over, a British officer was standing over him,
and giving directions to a party of Sepoys to have
him taken to the hospital; when, raising himself with
his left hand, with his right he cut the officer down
with his kookeree&mdash;a deadly weapon with which the
little Goorkhas now chop up the rebels.</p>

<p>Apropos of a kookeree in the hands of a Goorkha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
I must relate a little matter which I now know to be
a fact, but which I could scarcely credit when it was
first told to me. A party of Goorkhas&mdash;say fifteen or
twenty&mdash;will proceed to a jungle in which they know
there is a huge tiger. They will surround the jungle,
form a circle, and closing in gradually, hem in the
ferocious beast. Every man will then drop down on
the right knee, as soldiers do forming a square, and,
kookeree in hand, wait for the spring of the tiger, who
becomes somewhat bewildered and anxious to make
his escape. After moving about for a brief while in
this den, of which the bars are human beings (about
five feet high), and glaring first at one and then at
another, he lashes himself into a fury and makes his
spring: then the nearest Goorkha delivers a blow
with his kookeree which divides the tiger's skull.
Wonderful as this feat is, I once saw at Jutog, near
Simlah, a sight that struck me as even more wonderful.
A Goorkha battalion was (and now is) quartered
at Jutog. There was a festival at which the Goorkhas
sacrifice an ox. The adjutant of the battalion
asked me if I should like to witness the ceremony; as
it was something new to me, I replied in the affirmative,
and we walked to the parade ground, where the
whole regiment, in undress, was assembled, and surrounding
the victim and the executioner. The ox
was forced to kneel, and by the side of him knelt the
little Goorkha, armed with the kookeree, which is
nothing more than a huge curved knife, but very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
heavy, and as sharp as a razor. At a given signal he
struck the ox immediately behind the hump over the
shoulder, peculiar to all Indian cattle; and the body
was divided into two parts. He had, with a single
blow, gone though the ox just as completely and as
cleanly as a butcher with his hatchet would remove
a chop from a loin of mutton. They are a very odd
race of people, those little Goorkhas; wonderfully
honest even among themselves; light-hearted almost
to childishness; capable of enduring any amount of
toil; obedient and respectful, without cringing to,
fawning on, or flattering their superior, the white man.
The great blot upon their characters is their frightful
jealousy of their wives. Woe betide the woman who
gives her Goorkha husband the faintest reason to suspect
her of infidelity! He at once takes the law and
the kookeree into his own hands, and slays both the
wife and her (real or supposed) gallant. I am glad
to say this is not a frequent occurrence, though it does
happen now and then. As a body, the Goorkha
women are as virtuous as their husbands are honest
and brave.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Kumaon received us at Almorah,
his head-quarters, with great cordiality and
kindness, and offered us rooms in his house. This
offer we declined, inasmuch as our party consisted of
four, and his house was not a large one. Besides, he
had other visitors who were putting up at his bungalow.
We accepted, however, his invitation to dine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and on our way rode through the town, which is considered
the best in the British hill possessions. Bishop
Heber writes that Almorah reminds him of Chester.
It consists of one street about a mile and a half long,
and about sixty feet wide, paved with large slabs of
slate, and closed at either end by a gate. One half
of the town is much higher than the other, and the
street is divided in the middle by a low flight of steps
on which the ponies pass up and down with extraordinary
self-possession. The houses are small, but neat
and whitewashed. They all consist of two or more
stories. The lower ones are shaded by wooden verandahs
more or less carved. At one end of the town is
the old Goorkha fort; at the other end Fort Moira,
a small English fortification, near to which were the
Sepoy lines. A neat little church has just been
erected at Almorah. The people of the place are
all fair-complexioned, and some of the children as
white as those born of European parents.</p>

<h2>RETURNING.</h2>


<p>At Almorah I parted company with my foreign
friends. They intended crossing the mountains&mdash;the
snowy range&mdash;to pay a visit to Kanawur. This
was a journey for which I had not much inclination;
besides I was doubtful whether I could breathe at an
elevation of eighteen thousand feet above the level of
the sea. As it was, several of the coolies died of cold
and the rarity of the atmosphere. In fact, both of my
friends themselves had, as they informed me afterwards,
a very narrow escape. On several occasions
they were compelled to huddle themselves amongst the
coolies in their tent, and the sheep which they were
taking with them for food were kept alive for the
sake of the warmth they could impart in the canvas
abode. The grandeur of the scenery, they said,
would defy any attempt at describing it. What they
most wondered at was the impudence of that insect,
man, in daring to climb up into such regions.</p>

<p>My friend, the assistant magistrate, had still a fortnight
of unexpired leave, and proposed to me that
we should pay a visit to a friend of his at an out-of-the-way
station, called Bijnore. I had not the least
objection, and thither we went. We were most hospitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
received, partly out of regard for ourselves in
particular, but chiefly because our host had not seen
a white face for five weeks.</p>

<p>The cutcherry, or court-house, was undergoing repair,
and the magistrate, therefore, was obliged to administer
the duties of his office in his own abode, or
rather in the verandah; for a large number of half-clad
natives in a hot country do not impart to a confined
space an agreeable perfume by any means. To
me this scene&mdash;the native court&mdash;was particularly
interesting. There sat the covenanted official in an
arm-chair, with his solah hat on and a cheroot in his
mouth, listening very attentively to the sheristadar,
or head clerk, who was reading or singing aloud the
entire proceedings in the case then pending.</p>

<p>The prisoner, surrounded by half-a-dozen native
policemen, all with drawn swords, was standing ten
paces off. Ever and anon he interrupted the court
by protesting his innocence, and assuring the Sahib
that the whole of the depositions were false from
beginning to end. This interruption was usually&mdash;I
may say invariably&mdash;rebuked by the words, "Choop
raho, suer!" ("Hold your tongue, you pig!") And,
not unfrequently the nearest policeman accompanied
this mandate by giving the culprit a smart blow on
the back or a "dig in the ribs." I have seen prisoners
well thrashed in our Indian courts of justice by order
of the presiding magistrate for talking out of their
turn; but that was not the case in the present
instance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
No more violence was resorted to than was
absolutely necessary for the maintenance of order and
the progress of the trial. The offence of which the
prisoner stood charged was that of forging a bond
for five hundred rupees, and suing thereon for principal
and interest. The defence was, that the signature
to the bond was not a forgery, and that the
money had been advanced to the prosecutor; to prove
which, no fewer than seven witnesses were called.
Each of them swore, point blank, that, upon a certain
day and at a certain place, they saw the prisoner pay
over the money, and saw the prosecutor execute the
deed. To rebut this, the prosecutor called eleven
witnesses who swore, point blank, that, upon the day
and at the hour mentioned as the day and hour on
which the deed was executed, they met the prosecutor
at a village forty miles distant from Bijnore. In
short, if their testimony was to be relied upon, the
eleven witnesses had proved an alibi.</p>

<p>This was one of those cases which happen continually
in courts of justice in India; where the
magistrate or judge must not be, and is not, guided
by the oaths of the witnesses, but entirely by circumstances.
It is one of those cases, too, in which it
would be dangerous to consult the native officers of
the court; for having received bribes from both
parties, their advice would be dictated entirely by
pecuniary considerations. With them the question
would be simply out of which party&mdash;the accused or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the prosecutor&mdash;could most money be got in the event
of "guilty" or "not guilty." With regard to the
characters of the witnesses, they are pretty equal, and
generally very bad on both sides. Indeed, in nearly
all these cases, the witnesses are professionals; that is
to say, men who are accustomed to sell their oaths,
and who thoroughly understand their business. They
know exactly what to say when they come into court,
just as an actor, who is letter perfect in his part, knows
what to say when he comes on the boards. In fact,
a case is got up exactly as a play is. Each man has
his particular part and studies it separately; before
the day of trial comes they meet and rehearse, and
go through "the business" till they verily believe
(such is my opinion) that they are not perjured, but
are speaking the truth. As for shaking the testimony
of men so trained to speak to a certain string of facts,
I would defy the most eminent nisi prius advocate
in Europe. Besides, even if you should reject one
part of a statement, it does not follow, in a native
court, that you should reject the whole. The price
paid to these professional witnesses depends, in a great
measure, on the nature and magnitude of the cause.
It is about twelve per cent. out of the sum in dispute.
I believe it is distributed amongst the witnesses, and
the like sum amongst the native officers of the court.
This, of course, does not include little extra presents
given secretly to those who are supposed to have the
greatest amount of influence with the Sahib, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
pretend that they will speak to him favourably. The
personal servants, also, of the European magistrate
or judge expect some gratuity, and hang about a
client like the servants of badly regulated hotels
where attendance is not charged in the bill. It is
this that makes litigation so expensive in India that
even the successful party is often ruined before the
suit is half concluded.</p>

<p>"Tiffin is ready, Sahib," said the khansamah, coming
into the verandah, and placing his hands together in
a supplicating attitude. "It is on the table, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Then we will adjourn," said the magistrate, bowing
to me, and rising. This was at once the signal
for breaking up the day's proceedings.</p>

<p>The tiffin over, we began to play at whist, and continued
to do so until the sun had lost his power, when
the buggies were ordered, and we took a drive in
couples along a very bad road. It fell to my lot to
be the companion of the magistrate, a very able and
excellent man: one of the most efficient officers in
the East India Company's civil service. He was,
moreover, an admirable linguist, and spoke Hindostanee
as well as any native.</p>

<p>"You understood the proceedings to-day?" he
asked me.</p>

<p>"I followed them; yes."</p>

<p>"And you heard the evidence?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What would you say? Is he guilty or not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"I cannot say, although I have thought a good
deal on the point. Even while we were playing
whist, to-day's proceedings were uppermost in my
mind. Nothing can be clearer than that either one
side or the other is perjured."</p>

<p>"Both sides are perjured. If the bond be genuine,
the men who really witnessed the execution and who
subscribed their names as witnesses will not come
forward, or else they are such fools that the
native lawyer for the defence will not trust to
them lest they should be confused and commit themselves."</p>

<p>"But what do you think? Is the bond a genuine
document or not?"</p>

<p>"That is the very question. And when there is no
evidence to weigh, how are you to act?"</p>

<p>"I suppose that in those cases you give the prisoner
the benefit of the doubt?" I remarked.</p>

<p>"Not always. If I did that, I should acquit almost
every culprit that is brought before me, and so would
every judge throughout the length and breadth of the
land. By the way, about a year ago, I sent a case to
the sessions judge&mdash;a case of murder. I fancied there
could be no doubt as to the guilt of the accused;
which was the opinion of the sessions judge and of
the Sudder Court of Appeal. The man was hanged
about six weeks ago; and now I have discovered,
beyond all question, that he was hanged for the
offence of which his prosecutor was guilty! It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
be all very well for people in England to rail at the
administration of justice in this country; but they
would be less severe upon some of us if they could
only come out here and see the material with which
we have to deal. The administration of justice may
be, I confess, very much reformed and improved, but
where the great bulk of the people are corrupt, it
can scarcely be in anything like a perfect state."
This statement, remember, was made, by a magistrate
who speaks as well as writes the native language as
well as the natives themselves. But conceive the
confusion and injustice in those courts, where the
magistrates solely depend on corrupt moonshees for
what they know of the evidence.</p>

<p>There is but very little twilight in India; and by the
time that we had returned from the drive it was dark.
Shortly afterwards, dinner was announced. Dinner
over, we resumed our whist, and played until midnight.</p>

<p>The following day was a native holiday&mdash;a Hindoo
holiday. What with Hindoo holidays and Mahommedan
holidays, nearly a third of every year is
wasted: for, upon these days public business is suspended
and the various offices closed. It is devoutly
to be hoped that, when our rule in India is completely
re-established, these absurd concessions&mdash;these mere
pretexts for idleness&mdash;will no longer be suffered to
prevail. It is only the pampered native servants of
the Government, civil and military, who are clamorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
for the observance of these "great days," as they call
them. Go into the fields or ride through a bazaar on
one of these holidays and you will see the people at
their work, and the shopkeepers pursuing their respective
avocations. You pass the court-house, the
treasury, the magistrate's office, and observe that they
are all shut up. You ask the reason, and are informed
that it is a native holiday. You go to an establishment
founded and conducted by private enterprise&mdash;a
printing-office, for instance&mdash;and you observe
Hindoos of every caste, and Mussulmans also, at
their daily labour. Why? Because the head of
such an establishment stipulates that those who wish
for employ must work all the year round, and they
prefer employ on such terms to no employ at all.
So it is in some mercantile firms in Calcutta, and at
the other Presidencies; albeit such firms experience
very great inconvenience from the circumstance of
the Government banks being closed on these holidays;
if a merchant wishes to get a cheque cashed, or a bill
discounted, he must wait sometimes for days together.
Even the doors of the Queen's courts are often closed,
and the judges and the counsel left unemployed, notwithstanding
that the litigants are British subjects;
and this because the native writers in these courts
and the officers attached to them, are paid by the
Company's Government, which recognises absence
from duty on these holidays.</p>

<p>It would be hard to deprive either of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
sects of certain holidays in every year. The Doorgah-Poojah,
for instance, or the Mohurrum; but it is
sheer folly, and profitless withal, to sanction these
constantly repeated interruptions to public business.
The idlers of the covenanted civil service in India
are, naturally, in favour of closing the doors of the
various offices as often as possible; but the hard-working
portion, those men who take some interest
in the discharge of the duties for which they draw
their pay, regard the native holidays as an intolerable
nuisance which ought, long since, to have been
abolished.</p>

<p>Whilst we were enjoying ourselves after dinner, on
the evening of the Hindoo holiday, the khansamah
came in, and announced that two Sahibs had arrived.</p>

<p>"Two Sahibs?" said our host. "Who are they?"</p>

<p>"They are strangers to me, Sahib," said the khansamah,
"and they do not speak Hindostanee; but
their bearers say that they are Lord Sahibs."</p>

<p>"Who on earth can they be?" said the magistrate
of Bijnore (loudly) to himself; and, rising, he left the
table to make inquiry in person, and offer the travellers
every hospitality.</p>

<p>"O, I beg your pardon," said a voice from one of
the palanquins. "But would you be good enough to
tell me where I am?"</p>

<p>"You are at Bijnore," said the magistrate, blandly.</p>

<p>"Bij-what?"</p>

<p>"Bijnore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, how far am I from Meerut?"</p>

<p>"A very considerable distance&mdash;forty miles at
least."</p>

<p>"How the deuce is that?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;in the words of the Eton Latin Grammar&mdash;I
may reply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.
</div>

<p>But where have you come from?"</p>

<p>"From Seharry something or other; but confound
these nores, and pores, and bores! There's no recollecting
the name of any place, for an hour together.
The magistrate&mdash;I forget his name just now; but it was
Radley, Bradley, Bagley, Ragley, or Cragley, or some
such name&mdash;told me he would push me on to Meerut,
and here am I, it seems, forty miles out of my road!
Well, look here. I am Lord Jamleigh."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, you are welcome to some refreshment
and repose in my home, in common with your
friend; and whenever you desire to be 'pushed on,'
I will exert my authority to the utmost to further
your views."</p>

<p>"O, thank you. My friend is my valet. Here,
Mexton, jump out and take my things into a room."</p>

<p>While Mexton is obeying this order, and while his
lordship is following his host, let us inform the reader
who his lordship was, and what was the object of his
mission to India.</p>

<p>His lordship was a young nobleman, who was about
to enter Parliament, and, being desirous of acquiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
information concerning India in order to be very strong
when the question for renewing the charter came on
in eighteen hundred and fifty-two or fifty-three, he resolved
on travelling in the country for a few months:
the entire period of his absence from home, including
the journey overland, not to exceed half a year.
After a passage of thirty-four days&mdash;having already
seen the Island of Ceylon, and approved of it&mdash;his
lordship landed at Madras, was carried up to Government
house, where he took a hasty tiffin, and was
then carried back to the beach, whence he reembarked
on board the steamer, and was, three days
afterwards, landed at the Ghaut in Calcutta, where
he found a carriage ready to convey him to the vice-regal
dwelling. After two days' stay, he was "pushed
on," at his own request, to the Upper Provinces: his
destination being Lahore. The newspapers got hold
of his name, and came out with something of this
kind:&mdash;"Amongst the passengers by the <i>Bentinck</i> is
Lord Jamleigh, eldest son of the Right Honourable
the Earl of Dapperleigh. His lordship leaves Calcutta
this evening, and will pass through the following
stations." Then came a list. At many of
the stations he was met&mdash;officiously met, by
gentlemen in authority, who dragged&mdash;literally
dragged&mdash;him, in their anxiety to have a lord for a
guest, to their houses, and kept him there as long as
they could: taking care to have the north-west
journals informed of where and with whom his lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
had put up. He was not allowed to stay at a
d√¢k bungalow for an hour or two, and then proceed,
taking&mdash;in the strictest sense of the phrase&mdash;his
bird's-eye view of India, its people, its institutions,
and so forth. Some of them threw obstacles in the
way of his getting bearers, so that he might remain
with them for four-and-twenty hours, and thus
thoroughly impregnate and air their houses with an
aristocratical atmosphere. Others lugged him to
their courts and collectorates, albeit he had seen one
of each at Burdwan and Bengal, and consequently
had seen the working of the Indian judicial and
revenue departments, and knew all about them!
This sycophantic importunity of a few government
officials soured his lordship's temper, which imparted
to his manners a rudeness which was perhaps foreign
to his nature. His lordship was led to believe that
<i>all</i> Indian officials were a parcel of sycophants&mdash;progress-impeding
sycophants&mdash;and hence he grew to
treat them all alike: and he did not scruple, at last,
to extract his information from them much in the
same way that a petulant judge who has lost all
patience with a rambling witness, takes him out of
the hands of counsel, and brings him sharply to the
point. For instance, "I know all about that, but tell
me this,"&mdash;note-book in hand&mdash;would Lord Jamleigh
in such wise frequently interrogate his civil
hosts, who insisted on doing themselves the honour
of entertaining his lordship. The fact was that, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
his own opinion, he knew all about India and its
affairs long before he touched the soil, for he had
read a good deal in blue books and newspapers.
His object, as we have before hinted, was simply to
see the country and travel in it, or through it, and
thus arm himself with a tremendous and telling
weapon in a contested debate, should he take part
therein. And therefore when his lordship asked
questions it was not so much with a view to obtain
information as to test the accuracy of that already
acquired by reading, over the fireside in the library,
of his father's mansion in Bagdad Square. Thus, the
entries in his lordship's note-book were, after all,
merely a matter of form.</p>

<p>Having divested himself of the dust with which he
was covered, and having restored himself to his personal
comforts, his lordship joined our little party,
and partook of some dinner which the khansamah
had prepared for him. His repast concluded, his
lordship moistened his throat with a glass of cool
claret, and proceeded, in his own manner, to interrogate
his host, who was not only an accomplished
scholar, but a ready and refined wit. It was thus
that the dialogue was commenced and continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the number of inhabitants in this district?"
asked the noble guest.</p>

<p>"Upon my word I don't know; I have never
counted them," said the host.</p>

<p>"But have you no idea? Can't you give a guess?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes; some hundreds of thousands."</p>

<p>"Ah! And crime&mdash;much crime!" his lordship
persevered.</p>

<p>"Very much. But we are going to reduce it,
during the ensuing half-year, exactly thirty-three and
a-half per cent.," answered the magistrate, looking
uncommonly statistical.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is what my assistant and myself have
decided upon."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you. How can you possibly
say at this moment whether, during the next six
months, the amount of crime shall be greater or less?"
His lordship was puzzled.</p>

<p>"How? Why just in the same way that the directors
of a joint-stock bank determine in their
parlour what shall be the amount of dividend payable
to shareholders. My assistant wanted to make a
reduction of fifty per centum on the last returns;
but I think thirty-three and a-half will be a very fair
figure."</p>

<p>"You intend, perhaps, to be more severe?" said
the young legislator.</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. On the contrary, we
intend to be less energetic by thirty-three and a-half
per cent.&mdash;to take matters more easily, in
short."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what you meant."</p>

<p>"I will explain it to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>"As briefly as possible, please." His lordship did
not want to be bored, evidently.</p>

<p>"By all means."</p>

<p>"I only want facts, you see."</p>

<p>"And I am about to give you facts&mdash;dry facts."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The facts are these. There is a district in these
provinces nearly twice the size of this, and it contains
nearly double the number of inhabitants."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"During the past half-year, the number of convictions
in that district has been very much less than
the number of convictions in this district. And the
Sudder Court of Appeal has come to the conclusion,
on looking at the figures in the official return, that
the proportion of crime to population, in this district,
is greater than it is in that district."</p>

<p>"Very naturally."</p>

<p>"Indeed? But suppose that the magistrate of
that district only attends his court once or twice a-week,
and then only for an hour or two on those days;
and suppose that his assistant is a young man who
makes sport his occupation and his business, and
business his recreation and his sport. And suppose
that I and my assistant work hard, and do our best
to hunt up all the murderers, thieves, and other
culprits, whom we hear of, and bring them to justice
and to punishment. What then? Are the figures
in the official returns, touching the convictions, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
taken as any criterion of the crime perpetrated in
our respective districts?" His worship delivered
these questions triumphantly.</p>

<p>"In that case, certainly not."</p>

<p>"Well, the Sudder have looked at the convictions,
and the consequence has been, that in the last printed
report issued by that august body (composed of three
old and imbecile gentlemen) to the Government, the
magistrate of that district and his assistant have been
praised for their zeal, and recommended for promotion,
while the magistrate and assistant of this
district have been publicly censured; or, to use the
cant phrase of the report, 'handed up for the consideration
of the Most Noble the Governor-General
of India.'"</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" asked the Lord, throwing up his
hands.</p>

<p>"You ask for dry facts, and I have given you dry
facts."</p>

<p>"May I make a note of this?" (pulling out an
elegant souvenir). "Not that I should think of
mentioning your name."</p>

<p>"You may make a note of it; and, so far as mentioning
my name is concerned, you may do as you
please. I have already written to the Sudder what
I have stated to you," was the answer.</p>

<p>"What! about the thirty-three and a-half per
cent?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and, what is more, I have insisted on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
copy of the letter being forwarded to the Governor-General."</p>

<p>"And what will be the result, do you suppose?"</p>

<p>"I neither know nor care. I have just served
my time in this penal country; and, being entitled
to both my pardon and my pension, I intend to
apply shortly for both."</p>

<p>The reader will be glad to hear that a long correspondence
ensued on this subject between the
Sudder, the Government, and the mutinous magistrate.
The upshot was, that the imbecile old men
who had too long warmed that tribunal were pushed
off their stools by the Governor-General (Lord Dalhousie),
who, very meritoriously, bullied them into
resigning the service; threatening, as some say, to
hold a commission on their capacity for office. In
their stead were appointed three gentlemen, whose
abilities and vigour had hitherto been kept in the
back settlements of India. The crowning point of
all was, that the mutinous magistrate was one of the
illustrious three!</p>

<p>Lord Jamleigh informed us that he had seen
Lahore, and that he was about to go across the country
to Bombay, and that he should then have seen all three
Presidencies, as well as all the Upper Provinces,
and the Punjab. He regretted, half apologetically,
that he had not been able to take a look at the
Himalayas, Simlah and Mussoorie; but the fact was,
"he was so much pressed for time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor devils!" exclaimed our host, smiling. "But,
as they won't know anything about it, they won't
feel it much&mdash;indeed, not at all."</p>

<p>"To whom are you alluding?" asked my lord.</p>

<p>"The Himalayas," sighed our host, passing the
claret to his lordship, who, by this time, had discovered
that he had not got into a nest of sycophants,
who worshipped a title, no matter how frivolous or
how insolent the man might be who wore it; but
that he had accidentally fallen into the company of
persons of independent character; and albeit, they
were desirous of giving him a welcome and making
him comfortable&mdash;being a stranger who had lost his
way&mdash;nevertheless, were determined to make him
pay in some shape for the want of courtesy he had
exhibited when the bearers set his palkee down at
the door of the bungalow. This discovery made his
lordship a little uncomfortable, and rather cautious
in his observations. He felt, in short, as one who
knows that he has committed an error, and that some
penalty will be exacted; but what penalty, and how
exacted, he cannot imagine. Had he been able to
get away, he would probably have taken a hasty
farewell of us. But that was impossible. His
jaded bearers were cooking their food, and, until
twelve o'clock, there was no hope of getting them
together.</p>

<p>The khansamah came in with a fresh bottle of
wine. Our host, withdrawing his cigar from his lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
inquired of him if the wants of the gentleman's
servant had been attended to.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sahib," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And have you given him any champagne?"</p>

<p>"No, Sahib."</p>

<p>"Then do."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray do nothing of the kind!" exclaimed his
Lordship. "He is not accustomed to it."</p>

<p>"Then he will enjoy it all the more," said our
host. "I hope he is taking notes, and will write
a book on India. I should much like to see his impressions
in print; and he may possibly dignify me
by devoting a few lines to the character of my hospitality.
It is to be hoped, however, that, should his
travel inspire him with a thirst for literary distinction,
he will confine himself to a personal compilation of
his experience, and not go into judicial or revenue
matters; for, should he do so, you may find yourself
clashing with him, and that would be awkward. His
publisher's critic might be inclined to break a spear
with your publisher's critic, in their respective reviews
of your respective works, and it would be quite impossible
to conjecture where the controversy might
end. Indisposed as I am, generally, to obtrude my
advice upon any one, and much less on a perfect
stranger, I nevertheless feel that I am only doing you
a kindness when I say that, if I were you, I would
regard Hindostan as a sort of Juan Fernandez,
myself the Crusoe thereof, and this valet as my man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Friday; and then, with a due observance of that line
of demarcation which should always be drawn between
civilised man and the savage, I would not permit
him to keep even a stick whereon to notch the day
or time of any particular event that occurred during
my residence in the country, lest he should some day
or other&mdash;in consequence of my having discharged
him, or he having discharged me&mdash;rise up and instigate
some man or other to call in question the
accuracy of my facts. The wine is with you; will
you fill, and pass it on?"</p>

<p>Lord Jamleigh became very red in the face, and
rather confused both in manner and speech. As for
myself and the two assistant-magistrates, there was
something so benignant in the expression of our host's
handsome and dignified countenance&mdash;something so
quaintly sarcastic in the tone and manner of his discourse,
that, had we known that death was the penalty
of not maintaining the gravity of our features, our
lives would certainly have been forfeited.</p>

<p>A silence for several minutes ensued; and then
Lord Jamleigh spoke to our host as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Most of the young noblemen who come to this
country, come only to travel about and amuse themselves.
I come on business&mdash;I may say, Parliamentary
business. My time is short, and I must make the
most of it. I dare say, when you saw my name in the
papers, as having arrived in India, you little thought
that I was not a man of pleasure and excursion?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon my word, the subject never once became
a matter of speculation with me," said our host.</p>

<p>After some further conversation, in which our host
spared his visitor as little as was consistent with good
breeding, Lord Jamleigh, who had been "sitting
upon thorns," rose and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have already trespassed on your
goodness too long. I will not attempt to apolo&mdash;apolo&mdash;or
to express how much&mdash;how much; nor to
assure you that&mdash;assure you&mdash;that when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't mention it!" said our host, smiling.
"You desire your palkee?"</p>

<p>"If you please," said Lord Jamleigh.</p>

<p>The palkee was ordered, and we were standing in
expectation that it would be instantly announced as
"ready," when the sirdar-bearer (head personal attendant)
came into the room, in a state of excessive
trepidation, and informed us that the Sahib's Sahib
(Lord Jamleigh's valet) was drunk, asleep, and refused
to be disturbed on any pretence whatever.</p>

<p>This announcement, which caused general merriment,
induced Lord Jamleigh to ejaculate:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the champagne, I suspected as much!"</p>

<p>"Where is he?" inquired our host of the sirdar-bearer.
"In his palkee?"</p>

<p>"No, Sahib," was the reply. "He is lying on that
Sahib's bed," pointing to me.</p>

<p>Here, again, everybody laughed, except myself. I
was rather angry, being somewhat particular on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
point. So I suggested that he might be put into his
vehicle at once. The native servants, of course, were
afraid to touch him, lest he should awake and "hit
out;" so we, the five of us, Europeans, the magistrate,
the two assistant magistrates, Lord Jamleigh, and
myself, had to lift, remove, and pack in his palkee, the
overcome, and perfectly unconscious valet. He must
have been sipping brandy-and water before he came
to the bungalow, for he had only half finished his
bottle of champagne. Lord Jamleigh now got into
his palanquin, and composed himself for the night, or,
rather, the remainder of it, and in order that there
might be no mistake as to his Lordship's destination,
the magistrate sent a horseman to accompany the
cort√®ge, with directions that "the Sahibs" were to be
taken to Durowlah, on the road to Meerut, and to
the house of the magistrate, by whom Lord Jamleigh
had been invited, or rather, "petitioned," to stay
with him, should he pass through that station, and (to
use his Lordship's own terms), as he had promised to
do so, he supposed that he must keep his word. When
a palanquin is escorted by a sowar, the sowar when
the destination is approached, rides on and gives
notice that a lady, or gentleman, as the case may be,
is coming; and, as the natives of India can never
pronounce European names properly, the precaution
is usually taken of writing down the name of the
traveller on a card, or a slip of paper, and giving it
to the sowar. In this case, "Viscount Jamleigh"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
was written down for the guidance and information
of the Durowlah functionary.</p>

<p>It was about seven <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> when this card was put
into the hands of the gentleman who had invited
Lord Jamleigh; whom, by the way, he had never
seen. The bungalow was immediately all life and in
commotion; the servants ordered to prepare tea and
coffee; the best bed-room vacated by the present occupants;
hot water in readiness; and ere long a palkee&mdash;a
single palkee&mdash;loomed in the distance; the other
palkee was a long way, some three miles, behind.
One of the bearers who was carrying it, had fallen and
injured himself, and thus was a delay of an hour and
a half occasioned. And during that hour and half a
pretty mistake was committed. The first palkee was
that containing the valet, and the one behind was
that of his lordship. The valet had not recovered
the effects of his potations; and, on being awakened,
seemed, and really was, bewildered and stupified&mdash;so
much so, that he could not inform the magistrate
that he was "only a servant," and not entitled to the
attentions that were showered upon him. With
trembling hand, he took the cup of tea from the silver
salver, and gazing wildly round, murmured, rather
than said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Brandy! Little Brandy!" which was at once
brought and administered. He then had his warm
"wash," sat down on the best bed, and suffered
himself to be punkahed by two domestics in snow-white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
garments. This revived him somewhat; but
still he felt far too ill to talk. He simply shook his
head, and there was a good deal of meaning in that
shake, if the magistrate could only have understood it.</p>

<p>"Take some brandy and soda-water, my lord," said
his host.</p>

<p>The valet nodded assent.</p>

<p>The magistrate mixed the dose, and administered
it with his own hands.</p>

<p>The valet sighed, and again shook his head.</p>

<p>"You will be better presently, my lord," said the
magistrate.</p>

<p>"Drunk as a lord!" hiccuped the valet.</p>

<p>"O, no, my lord! It was the jolting along the
road."</p>

<p>"In that coffin?" said the valet, who now began to
regain the use of his tongue.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Am I a lord? He, he, he! Where am I?"</p>

<p>"At Durowlah, my lord."</p>

<p>"And who are <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"Your host, my lord."</p>

<p>"Then this is not the station-house?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, my lord."</p>

<p>"Give us a little drop more of that last brew."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Ah! Thank you! I feel better now&mdash;much
better. It was that champagne. Good it was,
though. What place was that we were at?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bijnore, my lord."</p>

<p>"I'm not a lord."</p>

<p>"Would that I were in your place, my lord!"</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't a bad place," grinned the valet.
"Plenty to eat and drink, little to do, and good
wages. But hang this Hindyer! It was a mistake
altogether!"</p>

<p>The magistrate took this for fun, laughed immensely,
and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had Lord Frederick Pontasguieure staying
with us for a week, last winter. A very amusing
character he was."</p>

<p>"O, had you? Was he amusing? O! We don't
keep his company. Don't know him. I'd give a five-pound
note to be in Piccadilly at this moment. This
is a nice mess. But the traps are all right, I see.
There's the dressing-case, and the writing-desk, and
the little medicine-chest."</p>

<p>"Recline upon the bed, my lord, and have a gentle
sleep. The punkah, you will find, will very speedily
lull you to repose."</p>

<p>"Well, I will," said the valet; and soon fell fast
asleep. The venetians were then closed, and the
house kept as quiet as possible.</p>

<p>When Lord Jamleigh himself arrived, and established
his identity, the scene that ensued may be
easily imagined.</p>

<p>The magistrate, with a marvellous want of tact,
acknowledged the mistake that he had made: told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
in fact, the whole uncomplimentary truth. Lord
Jamleigh, and perhaps with reason, was dreadfully
annoyed at the idea that the servant should have been
mistaken for himself; but he let out, however, that
that was the third time the thing had happened, and
that in future he should insist upon the fellow wearing
livery, instead of plain clothes, and a black wide-awake
hat.</p>

<p>The valet was speedily lifted out of the best bed,
and transferred to another apartment, where he slept
himself sober, and arose at about half-past one to explain
to his lordship that he was not much in fault.</p>

<p>I would advise all noblemen and gentlemen who,
like Lord Jamleigh, would take a bird's-eye look at
India, not to travel with an European servant, who,
in that country, is as helpless as an infant, and quite
as troublesome, besides being in the way of everybody
in every house. It is, moreover, cruel to the servant.
He can talk to no one, and becomes perfectly miserable.</p>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS.</h2>


<p>The house of a civilian (a magistrate and collector)
in the heart of a district, such as Bijnore, is really
worthy of contemplation. With the exception of a
bungalow, which is usually occupied by the assistant,
and which may, therefore, be said to belong to
the magistrate's house, there is no other Christian
abode within five-and-thirty or forty miles. The
house is usually well, but not extravagantly, furnished;
the walls are adorned with prints and
pictures, and the shelves well stored with books. In
a word, if the punkahs and the venetian blinds, the
therm-antidotes, and sundry other Indian peculiarities
were removed, you might fancy yourself in some
large country-house in England.</p>

<p>There was at Bijnore a native moonshee who was
a very good scholar; and, as I was anxious to read
Hindostanee and Persian with him (the more especially
as I much enjoyed the society of mine host and
his assistant), I was induced to accept an invitation
to remain for a month. During this period I studied
for several hours a-day, besides attending the Court
House regularly, to listen to the proceedings, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
acquire some knowledge of a most extraordinary
jargon, composed of a little Hindostanee, a little Persian,
and a good deal of Arabic. This jargon is
known in India as the language of the courts. A
good Persian and Hindostanee scholar cannot understand
it, unless he is accustomed to it. Many magistrates
and judges have insisted upon having pure
Hindostanee spoken; but to no purpose. Up to a
recent period, Persian mixed with Arabic was the
language in which legal proceedings were conducted,&mdash;Persian
and Arabic being as foreign languages to
the people of India as English, German, or French.
And, when the order went forth that Hindostanee
was to be used, the native officers of the courts, and
the native lawyers who practised therein, complied
with it by putting a Hindostanee verb at the end of
each sentence, and using the Hindostanee pronouns,
retaining in all their integrity (or rascality) the Persian
and Arabic adverbs, prepositions, nouns, adjectives,
and conjunctions. An indigo planter in Tahoot,
who spoke Hindostanee perfectly, having lived
amongst the natives for upwards of twenty years,
assured me that he did not comprehend a single sentence
of a decree in court Hindostanee, that he heard
read out to him&mdash;a decree in a case to which he was
a party. What is even more absurd, each court has
its own peculiar jargon, so that the magistrate or
judge, who from long experience has acquired a
thorough knowledge of the jargon of his own court,
has very great difficulty in comprehending the jargon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
of another court. This might be altered by fining
any officer of court, or native lawyer, who, in matters
connected with a suit, used words and phrases unintelligible
to the mass of the people; but the order
would have to emanate from Government. No
magistrate or judge would venture on even an attempt
to bring about so desirable a reform.</p>

<p>Whilst at Bijnore, I was seized with an attack of
tic-douloureux, and suffered all its extreme agonies.
One of my host's servants informed me that there
was a very clever native doctor in the village, who
could immediately assuage any pain&mdash;tooth-ache, for
instance&mdash;and he begged permission to bring him to
see me. I consented.</p>

<p>The native doctor was a tall, thin Mussulman, with
a lofty forehead, small black eyes, long aquiline nose,
and finely chiselled mouth and chin. His hair, eye-brows,
and long beard were of a yellowish white, or
cream colour. Standing before me in his skull-cap,
he was about the most singular looking person I ever
beheld. His age did not exceed forty-four or forty-five
years. He put several questions to me, but I
was in too great pain to give him any replies. He
begged of me to sit down. I obeyed him, mechanically.
Seating himself in a chair immediately opposite
to me, he looked very intently into my eyes.
After a little while, his gaze became disagreeable, and
I endeavoured to turn my head aside, but I was
unable to do so. I now felt that I was being mesmerized.
Observing, I suppose, an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
anxiety, if not of fear, on my features, he bade me not
to be alarmed. I longed to order him to cease; but, as
the pain was becoming less and less acute, and as I
retained my consciousness intact, I suffered him to
proceed. To tell the truth, I doubt whether I could
have uttered a sound. At all events, I did not make
the attempt. Presently, that is to say, after two or
three minutes, the pain had entirely left me, and I
felt what is commonly called, all in a glow. The
native doctor now removed his eyes from off mine,
and inquired if I were better. My reply, which I
had no difficulty in giving at once, was in the affirmative;
in short, that I was completely cured.
Observing that he placed his hands over his head,
and pressed his skull, I asked him if he were suffering.</p>

<p>"Yes, slightly," was his reply; "but I am so
accustomed to it, it gives me but little inconvenience."</p>

<p>I then begged of him to explain to me how it was
that he had the power to afford me such miraculous
relief. That, he said, he was unable to do. He did
not know. I then talked to him of mesmerism and
of the wonderful performances of Dr. Esdaile, in the
Calcutta hospital. He had lately heard of mesmerism,
he said; but, years before he heard of it, he was in
the habit of curing people by assuaging their pain.
The gift had been given to him soon after he attained
manhood. That, with one exception, and that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
in the case of a Keranee&mdash;a half-caste&mdash;no patient
had ever fallen asleep, or had become beehosh (unconscious),
under his gaze. "The case of the half-caste,"
he went on to say, "alarmed me. He fell
asleep, and slept for twelve hours, snoring like a man
in a state of intoxication." I was not the first European
he had operated upon, he said; that in Bareilly,
where he formerly lived, he had afforded relief to
many officers and to several ladies. Some had tooth-ache,
some tic-douloureux, some other pains. "But,"
he exclaimed, energetically, "the most extraordinary
case I ever had, was that of a Sahib who had gone
mad&mdash;'drink delirious.' His wife would not suffer
him to be strapped down, and he was so violent that
it took four or five other Sahibs to hold him. I was
sent for, and, at first, had great difficulty with him
and much trembling. At last, however, I locked his
eyes up, as soon as I got him to look at me, and kept
him for several hours as quiet as a mouse, during
which time he had no brandy, no wine, no beer; and,
though he did not sleep, he had a good long rest. I
stayed with him for two days, and whatever I told
him to do he did immediately. He had great sorrow
on his mind, poor man. Three of his children had
died of fever within one short week, and he had lost
much money by the failure of an agency-house in
Calcutta. There was a cattle serjeant, too, an European,
whom I also cured of that drinking madness by
locking up his eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you mean by locking up his eyes?"</p>

<p>"Well, what I did with you; I locked up your
eyes. When I got his eyes fixed on mine, he could
not take them away&mdash;could not move."</p>

<p>"But can you lock up any one's eyes in the way
that you locked up mine?"</p>

<p>"No; not everybody's. There was an artillery captain
once who defied me to lock up his eyes. I tried
very hard; but, instead of locking up his, he locked
up mine, and I could not move till he permitted me.
And there was a lady, the wife of a judge, who had
pains in the head, which I could not cure, because
she locked up my eyes. With her I trembled much,
by straining every nerve, but it was of no use."</p>

<p>"Do you know any other native who has the same
power that you possess?"</p>

<p>"Only three; but, I dare say, there may be hundreds
in these provinces who have it, and who use it.
And now, Sahib," said the native doctor, taking from
his kummerbund (the cloth that encircles the waist)
a bundle of papers, "I desire to show you some of
my certificates, at the same time to beg of you to
pardon my apparent want of respect in appearing in
your presence in this skull-cap instead of a turban;
but the fact is, that when I heard you were in such
great pain, I did not think it humane to delay until
I had adorned myself."</p>

<p>I proceeded to examine very carefully every one of
his many certificates; not that I was in any way interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
in them, but because I knew it would afford
him great pleasure. In all, they were quite as numerous
as those which English charlatans publish in
testimony of their skill in extracting corns. They
were more elaborate however; for it is by the length
of a certificate that a native judges of its value&mdash;just
in the same way that Partridge, when Tom Jones
took him to see <i>Hamlet</i>, admired the character of
the King, because he spoke louder than any of
the company, "anybody could see that he was a
king." As for myself, I sat down and covered a
whole sheet of foolscap in acknowledgment of my
gratitude to Mustapha Khan Bahadoor, for having
delivered me from unendurable torments. To my
certificate I pinned a cheque on the North-West
Bank for one hundred rupees (ten pounds), and, presenting
both documents to the doctor, permitted him
to take his leave. Some months afterwards, on discovering
that this cheque had not been presented for
payment, I wrote to the assistant-magistrate, and
asked him, as a favour, to send for the native doctor,
and obtain some information on the subject. In reply,
I was informed that the doctor preferred keeping the
cheque appended to my certificate as an imperishable
memorial of the extraordinary value in which his
services had been held by an European gentleman,
and that he would not part with it for ten times the
amount in gold or silver. Such a strange people are
the natives of India! Their cupidity is enormous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
certainly, but their vanity (I am speaking of the
better class) is even greater. One hundred rupees
was equal to half a year's earnings of the native
doctor, and yet he preferred holding the useless autograph
of an insignificant Sahib like myself for the
amount rather than realize it. The native doctor
evidently reasoned thus:&mdash;"I might spend the one
hundred rupees, might not be believed if I made the
assertion that I had received it; but here is the
voucher." Some may imagine that he kept it as a
sort of decoy-duck; but this I am perfectly satisfied
was not the case.</p>

<p>I was now about to leave Bijnore, and, as time was
of no object to me, I made up my mind to travel no
more by palkee, or horse d√¢k, but in the most independent
and comfortable manner. I therefore provided
myself with two small tents, and two camels to
carry them, two bullocks to carry the tent furniture,
my baggage, and stores; a pony for my own riding,
and a similar animal for a boy khitmutghur, who was
also my personal servant or bearer.</p>

<p>I engaged also a cook and a sweeper, or general
helper; so that, when the sawans (camel drivers), the
bullock-man, and the syces (grooms), were included,
my establishment numbered, in all, eight servants,
whose pay in the aggregate amounted to fifty rupees
(five pounds) per mensem. This, of course, included
their "keep," for they provided themselves with food.
The expense of keeping the camels, the bullocks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the ponies, was, in all, thirty-five rupees (three pounds
fifteen shillings) per mensem; while my own expenses,
including everything (except beer and cheroots), were
not in excess of fifty rupees per month; so that I was
thus enabled to travel about India at a cost of not
more than two hundred pounds per annum, or two
hundred and twenty-five pounds at the very outside.
The reader must remember that in almost every one
of the villages in India, fowls, eggs, rice, flour, native
vegetables, curry stuff, and milk are procurable, and
at very small prices, if your servants do not cheat you,
and mine did not; for I made an agreement with
my boy khitmutghur to that effect; indeed, I entered
into a regular contract with him previous to starting,
touching the purchase of every article that would
be required during my journey. This boy was, in
short, my commissariat department. His name was
Shumsheer (a word signifying in the Persian language,
"a sword"), but he generally went by the name of
Sham. He had been for several months in the service
of the assistant magistrate of Bijnore; who, as a very
great favour, permitted the boy to accompany me on
my travels; he was so clever, so sharp, so intelligent,
and so active a servant. He was not more than sixteen,
and very short, for his age; but stoutly built,
and as strong as a young lion. He was, moreover,
very good-looking, and had, for a native of Hindoostan,
a very fair complexion. He had been for several
years the servant, or page, of an officer on the staff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
a governor-general, and he spoke English with considerable
fluency, but with an idiom so quaint, that it
was amusing in the last degree to listen to him. He
had been "spoilt," in one sense of the word, while
at Government House, not only by his own master,
but by the whole staff, who had encouraged him to
give his opinions on all subjects with a freedom
which was at first very disagreeable to me. But, ere
long, I too encouraged him to do so; his opinions were
so replete with such strong common sense, and were
expressed in such an original fashion. If an inquiry
touching a certain administration had been called for
by Parliament, what an invaluable witness would
that boy have been before a Committee of either
house&mdash;provided he had not been previously "tampered
with!"</p>

<p>When all my preparations had been completed, I
took leave of my friends, and left Bijnore at three
o'clock one morning. My destination was Umballah.
I did not take the main road; but a shorter cut across
the country, conducted by a guide who knew the district
well, and who was enjoined to procure for me
another guide as soon as his information failed
him.</p>

<p>By seven o'clock we had travelled over twelve miles
of ground, and as the sun was beginning to be very
warm, I commanded a halt. Our tents were then
pitched beneath a tope (cluster) of mango-trees whose
branches formed a dense shade. Having bathed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
breakfasted, smoked, and read several pages of a Persian
book, I fell asleep, and was not awakened until
noon, when Sham came into my tent and reported
that there was an abundance of black partridge in the
neighbourhood: he then proposed that I should dine
early&mdash;at one <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&mdash;and at half past four take my
gun; and, permitting him to take another, sally forth
in search of the game. To this proposal I at once
assented, and removing my camp stool to the opening
of my little hill tent, I looked out into the fields,
where I saw some men ploughing. For the first time
during my travels I was struck with the appearance
of the instrument which the natives use for tilling the
soil; an instrument which, in fact, closely resembles
that used by the Romans, according to the directions
laid down in the Georgics:</p>

<div class="center">
"Curvi formam adcipit ulmus aratri," &amp;c., &amp;c.,<br />
</div>

<p>and at first I felt some surprise that an implement so
apparently ill-fitted for the purpose for which it is
designed, should answer all the requirements of the
cultivator. The substitution of the English plough
for this native h√πr has been several times projected
by gentlemen who were zealous in the cause of agriculture;
but without any success, or reasonable hope
thereof; for when we consider the cheapness, and the
great amount of labour always available, the general
lightness of the soil, the inaptitude of the natives of
India for great or continued physical exertion, the
inferiority of the cattle, all of which are the marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
characteristics of India, it would not only be undesirable,
but impossible to introduce the English plough
generally as an implement of husbandry&mdash;an implement
requiring physical strength, manual dexterity,
and a superior breed of cattle for draught. Rude and
simple as the native h√πr is, or as it may seem to the
casual observer, cursorily viewing the operation of
ploughing, it has still many good qualities which render
it peculiarly suited to the genius of the Indian
cultivator; and it is not in any immediate endeavour
to improve it or alter it that any real benefit can be
conferred on the cause of Indian agriculture. All the
efforts, therefore, that have been made in that direction
have been time and trouble expended to no purpose.
It has been said that all improvement to be
real must be spontaneous, or take rise within itself;
and it would seem to be more reasonable to improve
such means and appliances as the natives use and understand,
without running counter to the ideas and
shocking the prejudices which they entertain, by endeavouring
to compel their adoption of European
modes of culture, which, however well suited to the
land of their origin, have not the quality most necessary
to their practicability, that of being comprehensible
to the people of India. The true end of agriculture:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">"with artful toil</span><br />
To 'meliorate and tame the stubborn soil,<br />
To give dissimilar yet fruitful lands<br />
The grain, or herb, or plant, that each demands,"<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>is best to be attained by aiding and assisting the development
of those resources of the soil which have
already been made visible by the people themselves.</p>

<p>Here it is that the duty of the Government begins.
The precariousness of the land tenure is one of
the greatest impediments to the outlay of capital by
the tenant in the improvement of the land; and as
there is but little prospect of the removal of this objection,
the Government should fulfil what would,
were the case different, be the obvious plans of the
landholder in developing the resources of the soil.
Irrigation and manure are the two great points most
deserving of attention. On both points the resources
of the country are incalculable; the advantages evident
and immediate; both require system and an
outlay of capital, which the zemindar (native landholder)
is often unable, and oftener unwilling, to adopt
and incur&mdash;from want of confidence in the administration
of the law and the law itself. With the ryot,
or cultivator, the case is very different. The law, or
the administration thereof, affects him in a very slight
degree compared with the zemindar. The land tenure
matters very little to him; his rights have been secured;
he profits by the outlay of capital on the land.
Risk he has none. His advantage is immediate. But
he does not possess the means of improvement in any
way. He may build a well, dig a tank, or plant a
grove to the memory of a departed ancestor, and by
so doing enhance the value of the land to the zemindar;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
but he almost always ruins himself by the act,
leaving his debts to be paid by his descendants, and
the well, tank, or grove mortgaged to the banker for
the extra expenses incurred in its establishment! It
behoves an enlightened Government to do for the
people and the country what they are unable to do for
themselves. An inquiry properly set on foot, and
undertaken by competent persons on the part of the
Government, to investigate all particulars regarding
the state of agriculture, would bring to light many
facts, which, if made fitting use of, would not only
greatly redound to the honour but adduce greatly to
the advantage and profit of the State. The information
thus acquired, and not founded on the reports of
native (Government) collectors, police officers, and
peaons (messengers), but ascertained by the personal
inspection of European officials, and from the opinions
of the zemindars and cultivators themselves, would
enable the Government to know and devise remedies
to obviate the evils arising out of the gradual decline
of the agricultural classes in our earliest occupied territories.
It would show the Government many places
where the expenditure of four or five thousand rupees
(four or five hundred pounds) in the repairs or erection
of a dam, for the obstruction of some rain-filled
nullah (a wide and deep ditch), would yield a return
yearly of equal amount, besides affording employment,
and the means of livelihood to hundreds of persons.
It would show where the opening of a road, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
building of a bridge, involving but a small expenditure,
would give a new life to a part of the country
hitherto forgotten, and render the inhabitants flourishing
and happy, by throwing open to them a market
for their produce&mdash;a market at present out of
their reach. It would prove incontestably that the
means of irrigation&mdash;the true water-power of India,
has been even more neglected than the water-power
of that (in comparison with the United States) sluggish
colony, Canada. The initial step once taken&mdash;the
march of improvement once fairly set on foot&mdash;private
enterprise, duly encouraged, will follow in the
wake of the Government; and capital once invested,
land in India will become intrinsically valuable, and
thus obtain the attention it merits. Agricultural improvement
would induce lasting and increasing prosperity
of the cultivating classes (the bulk of the
population) and of the country itself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"What! Sham! Dinner ready?" I exclaimed, on
observing the boy approaching the tent with a tray
and a table-cloth.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; quite ready. And very good
dinner."</p>

<p>"What have you got?"</p>

<p>"Stewed duck, sir&mdash;curry, sir; pancake, sir. And
by the time you eat that, one little quail ready, sir,
with toast. I give dinner fit for a governor-general,
sir; and the silver shining like the moon, sir."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>(It was in this way that he ran on whilst laying the
table.)</p>

<p>"But why are you preparing covers for two, when
I am dining alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But only poor mans has table laid for
one. That place opposite is for company sake. And
suppose some gentleman come&mdash;not likely here, but
suppose? Then all is ready. No running about&mdash;no
calling out, 'Bring plate, knife and fork, and spoon,
and glass,' and all that. And if two plates laid, master,
if he like&mdash;when I am standing behind his chair keeping
the flies off while he eats&mdash;may fancy that some
friend or some lady sitting opposite, and in his own
mind he may hold some guftoogoo (conversation).
That's why I lay the table for two, sir."</p>

<p>I had been warned by the gentleman who permitted
Sham to accompany me, that he was such an
invaluable servant, it was only politic to let him have
his own way in trifling matters; and therefore instead
of objecting to his proceeding, I applauded his
foresight.</p>

<p>Whilst discussing the stewed duck, which was excellent&mdash;as
was indeed every dish prepared by Sham,
when he had "his own way&mdash;" and while he was standing
behind me, keeping the flies off with a chowrie
(a quantity of long horsehair fastened to a handle), I
talked to him without turning my head:</p>

<p>"You say you wish to take a gun. Have you ever
been out shooting?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir. When my master went up from
Calcutta to Mussoorie and Simlah with the Governor-General,
I went with him. And I often went out
shooting in the Dhoon, with my master, who was a
great sportsman, sir. And I was out with my master&mdash;on
the same elephant&mdash;when the Governor-General
shot the tiger."</p>

<p>"What! Did the Governor-General shoot a
tiger?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. But my master and the other gentlemens
make him think he did, sir."</p>

<p>"Explain yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the Governor-General said he had heard
a great deal of tiger shooting, and should like to see
some for once. So my master, who was a very funny
gentleman, went to an officer in the Dhoon&mdash;another
very funny gentleman&mdash;and between them it was
agreed that his lordship should shoot one tiger. And
so they sent out some native shikarees (huntsmen),
told them to wound but not kill one big tiger in the
jungle, and leave him there. And the native shikarees
did shoot one big tiger in the jungle, and they
came and made a report where he was lying. Then
next morning when all the elephants and gentlemens
was ready, and the Governor-General had his gun in
his hand, they all went to the jungle; and when they
got to the place and heard the tiger growl very angrily,
my master called out; 'There, my lord&mdash;there he is;
take your shot!' and my lord fired his gun, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
master cried out very loud: 'My lord, you've hit
him!' And my lord, who was very much confused&mdash;not
being a sportsman&mdash;said, 'Have I?' And all the
gentlemens cried out: 'Yes, my lord!' And then
some of the gentlemens closed round the tiger and
killed him, by firing many bullets at him. And my
lord had the tiger's skin taken off, and it was sent to
England to be make a carpet for my lord's sitting-room.
And for many days all the gentlemens laughed,
and asked of one another, 'Who shot the tiger?' And
the Governor-General was so happy and so proud, and
wore his head as high as a seesu-tree. But he had
enough of tiger-shooting in that one tiger; for he was
not a sportsman, and did not like the jolting of the
elephant in the jungle."</p>

<p>My repast ended, and the table-cloth removed, I
lighted a cigar, and took my camp-stool once more
to the opening of the tent, when, to my surprise, and
somewhat to my dismay, I found myself besieged by
a host of ryots, cultivators of the soil, each bearing a
present in the shape of a basket of fruit or vegetables,
or a brass dish covered with almonds, raisins, and
native sweetmeats. These poor creatures, who doubtless
fancied that I was a Sahib in authority (possibly,
Sham had told them that I was a commissioner&mdash;a
very great man&mdash;on a tour of inspection), prostrated
themselves at my feet, and in the most abject manner
imaginable craved my favour and protection. I promised
each and every one of them, with much sincerity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
that if ever it lay in my power to do them a
service, they might depend upon my exerting myself
to the utmost; and then I made a variety of inquiries
touching their respective ages, families, circumstances,
and prospects, in order to prove that I had already
taken an interest in them. I then asked them some
questions touching the game in the locality, and was
glad to hear the report made by Sham confirmed to
the letter. I was assured that the light jungle in
the rear of my tents literally swarmed with black
partridges.</p>

<p>It was now nearly time to go out, and in the course
of two hours I brought down no less than seven brace,
while Sham distinguished himself by killing five birds.
By the time I returned to my tent I was weary, and
retired to rest, having previously given orders that I
was to be called at two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, insomuch as at that hour
I intended to resume the march. It is one thing,
however, to retire to rest, but it is another thing to
sleep. What with the croaking of the frogs in a
neighbouring tank, and the buzzing and biting of the
musquitoes in my tent, I could not close an eye. I
lay awake the whole night, thinking&mdash;thinking of a
thousand things, but of home chiefly; and right glad
was I when Sham approached my bed, holding in
one hand a cup of very hot and strong coffee, and in
the other my cigar-case, while the noise outside, incident
on the striking of the tents and the breaking
up of the little camp, was as the sweetest music to
my ears.</p>

<h2>FORWARD.</h2>


<p>I was twelve days marching from Bijnore to Umballah,
and, by keeping away from the high-road, I
did not see during my journey a single European
face. I moved entirely amongst the people, or rather
the peasantry, of the Upper Provinces of India&mdash;a very
poor and very ignorant peasantry, but, comparatively
speaking, civil and honest. Sham made a much
greater impression upon them than I did; mounted
on his pony, and dressed in very gay attire&mdash;a purple
velvet tunic, pyjamahs of red silk trimmed with gold
lace, a turban of very gorgeous aspect, and shoes embroidered
all over with silver. He had more the
appearance of a young rajah or prince than a gentleman's
servant. And Sham talked to his countrymen&mdash;if
the wretched Hindoos could be so called&mdash;in a
lofty strain which vastly amused me, though I did
not approve of it. I said nothing, however. As for
the camp arrangements, he had completely taken
them out of my hands, and he was so much better
manager than myself that I was well content that it
should be so; all that was left to me was to name the
hour for departing from an encampment-ground, and
the next spot whereon I wished my tents pitched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>It was past six o'clock on the morning of the 20th
of April, when I came within a few miles of Umballah.
The mornings and the nights were still cool;
but, in the day the heat was beginning to be very
severe. However, after taking my coffee and making
my toilet, I caused my pony to be re-saddled, and,
followed by Sham mounted on his pony, rode into
the cantonments, inquiring my way, as I went along,
of the various servants who were moving about. I
eventually found myself at the door of a bungalow,
which was tenanted by a very old friend and distant
connexion of mine. He was an officer in one of her
Majesty's regiments of foot, then stationed at Umballah.</p>

<p>"You will sleep here, of course, during your stay,"
he said; "but you are the guest of the mess, remember.
We have settled all that, and we will go
up in the buggy presently to deposit your pasteboard
in the mess reading room. I will point out to you
where you will always find your knife and fork, and
I will introduce to you all the servants&mdash;the mess-sergeant
especially."</p>

<p>I must now digress for a brief while, in order to give
the uninitiated reader some idea of Indian etiquette
as it exists amongst Europeans, members of society.
In other countries, or at all events in England, when
a gentleman goes to take up his abode, for a long or
a short period, in a strange locality, it is usual for the
residents, if they desire to show him any civility, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
make his acquaintance, to call upon him in the first
instance. In India the reverse is the case. The
stranger must make his round of calls, if he wishes to
know the residents; and, what is more, he must leave
his cards on the mess, "for the colonel and officers of
her Majesty's &mdash;&mdash; Regiment." You may leave a
card on every officer in the regiment, from the
senior colonel down to the junior ensign; and each of
them may, and possibly will, invite you to his private
board; but, if you omit to leave a card on the mess,
it would be a gross breach of decorum in any member
of the mess to invite you to dine at the mess-table,
because you have "not left a card on the mess." And
not only to the royal regiments does the rule pertain,
but to every regiment in India, and to every brigade
of artillery.</p>

<p>Having left my cards at the mess of the regiment
to which my friend belonged, I was driven to the
mess-house of the &mdash;&mdash; Dragoons, where another
expenditure of cards was incurred; then to the mess-houses
of the two native infantry regiments, and the
mess-house of the native cavalry regiment. I was
then whisked off to the house of General Sir Doodle
Dudley, G.C.B., who commanded the division. The
General was very old, close upon eighty; but he was
"made up" to represent a gentleman of about forty.
His chestnut wig fitted him to perfection, and his
whiskers were dyed so adroitly, that they were an
exact imitation of their original colour. The white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
teeth were all false; likewise the pink colour in the
cheeks and the ivory hue of the forehead. As for the
General's dress, it fitted him like a glove, and his
patent leather boots and his gold spurs were the
neatest and prettiest I had ever seen. In early life
Sir Doodle had been a rival and an acquaintance of
Beau Brummell. When a Colonel in the Peninsular
war, he had been what is called a very good regimental
officer; but, from 1818 until his appointment to India,
in 1847, as a General of Division, he had been unattached,
and had never done a single day's duty. He
was so hopelessly deaf, that he never even attempted
to ask what was said to him; but a stranger, as I was,
would scarcely have credited it; for the General
talked, laughed, and rattled on as though he were
perfectly unconscious of his infirmity. I ventured a
casual remark touching the late dust-storm which
had swept over the district, to which the General
very vivaciously replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, my good sir. I knew her in the zenith of
her beauty and influence, when she was a lady patroness
of Almack's, and the chief favourite of his
Royal Highness the Prince Regent. Oh, yes! she is
dead, I see by the last overland paper; but I did not
think she was so old as they say she was&mdash;eighty-four.
Only fancy, eighty-four!" Then darting off
at a tangent, he remarked, "I see they give it out
that I am to have the command-in-chief at Bombay.
The fact is, I don't want Bombay, and so I have told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
my friends at the Horse Guards at least a dozen
times. I want the governorship and the command-in-chief
at the Cape; but, if they thrust Bombay
upon me, I suppose I must take it. One can't always
pick and choose, and I fancy it is only right to oblige
now and then."</p>

<p>"We shall be very sorry to lose you, General,"
said my friend, mechanically; "very sorry indeed."</p>

<p>"So I have told his Excellency," exclaimed the
General, who presumed that my friend was now
talking on an entirely different subject. "So I have
told him. But he will not listen to me. He says
that if the court-martial still adheres to its finding of
murder, he will upset the whole of the proceedings,
and order the man to return to his duty; and the
court <i>will</i> adhere to its original finding; for the court
says, and I say, that a private who deliberately loads
his firelock, and deliberately fires at and wounds a
serjeant, cannot properly be convicted of manslaughter
only. Well, it cannot be helped, I suppose. The
fact is, the commander-in-chief is now too old for his
work; and he is, as he always was, very obstinate and
self-willed." And the General continued, "For the
command of an army or a division in India, we want
men who are not above listening to the advice of
the experienced officers by whom they are surrounded!"</p>

<p>When we were leaving the General, he mistook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
me for my friend and my friend for me, and respectively
addressed us accordingly (his eyesight was very
imperfect, and he was too vain to wear glasses). He
thanked me for having brought my friend to call
upon him, and assured my friend that it would afford
him the greatest pleasure in the world if the acquaintance,
that day made, should ripen into
friendship.</p>

<p>"He is an imbecile," I remarked, when we were
driving away from the General's door.</p>

<p>"Yes; and he has been for the last six or seven
years," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But he must be labouring under some delusion
with respect to being appointed to the command-in-chief
of an Indian presidency?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind. He is certain of it. He
will go to Bombay before six weeks are over, you
will see."</p>

<p>The General <i>did</i> go to Bombay, where he played
such fantastic tricks before high heaven, that the
angels could not have "wept" for laughing at them.
Amongst other things, he insisted on the officers of
the regiments buttoning their coats and jackets up
to the throat, during the hottest time of the year.
He would have nothing unmilitary, he said, "hot
climate or no hot climate." He was quite childish
before he relinquished his command, and was brought
home just in time to die in his fatherland, and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
country-seat of his aristocratic ancestors. Although
utterly unfitted, in his after life, to command troops,
he was a very polished old gentleman, externally;
and, having enjoyed a very intimate acquaintance
with Bl√ºcher, and other celebrated commanders, he
could repeat many anecdotes of them worthy of remembrance.
"Bl√ºcher," he used to say, "generally
turned into bed all standing, jack-boots included;
and, if his valet forgot to take off his spurs, and they
became entangled with the sheets, woe betide the
valet. The torrent of abuse that he poured forth
was something terrific." I also heard the General
say that Bl√ºcher, having seen everything in London,
remarked with great earnestness, "Give me Ludgate
Hill!" and on being asked to explain why, replied,
with reference to the number of jewellers' and silversmiths'
shops which in that day decorated the
locality,</p>

<p>"Mein Gott! what pillage!"</p>

<p>After leaving the General's house, we called upon
some six or eight other magnates of Umballah for
the time being; and on returning to the mess-house
at the hour of tiffin, I was rather fatigued. The
scene, however, revived me considerably. There were
seated round the large table, in the centre of the
lonely room, some seventy or eighty officers of all
ranks, from the various regiments in the station.
There was to be a meeting held that day at the
mess-room, to discuss some local matter, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
majority of those present had been invited to "tiff"
previously. No one was in uniform&mdash;at least, not
in military uniform; all wore light shooting-coats
and wide-awake hats, covered with turbans. The
local question, touching the best means of watering
the mall, where the residents used to take their evening
ride or drive, having been discussed, the party
broke up. Some went to the different billiard-rooms
to play matches (for money, of course); others retired
to private bungalows to play cards, or read, while
reclining on a couch or a bed, or a mat upon the
floor. Every one smoked and sipped some sort of
liquid. It was to a room in my friend's bungalow
that eleven of the party, inclusive of myself, repaired,
to while away the time until sundown, by playing
whist.</p>

<p>Never did the character of an officer's life in India
strike me so forcibly as on that afternoon. There
was an air of lassitude and satiety about every one
present. The day was hot and muggy, and the
atmosphere very oppressive. It was a fatiguing bore
to deal the cards, take up the tricks, mark the game,
or raise to one's lips the claret cup which Sham had
been called upon to brew. Sham was well known to
most of the officers of the regiment to which my
friend belonged. He had made their acquaintance
(to use his own words) when he was on the Governor-General's
staff.</p>

<p>The three men who had not cut in at whist were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
lounging about, and making ineffectual attempts to
keep up a conversation. The shooting-coats and the
waistcoats were now discarded, and the suspenders,
and the shoes, or boots; in short, each person only
wore strictly necessary clothing, while the native
(coolie) in the verandah was ever and anon loudly
called upon to pull the punkah as strongly as possible.
That room that afternoon presented a perfect picture
of cantonment life in India during the summer
season, between the hours of two and half-past five,
<span class="smcap">p.m.</span> The body is too much exhausted to admit of
any serious mental exertion beyond that which sheer
amusement can afford; and it is by no means uncommon
to find your partner or yourself dropping
off to sleep when called upon to lead a card, or follow
suit. The three men who were sitting (or lying) out,
soon yielded to the influence of the punkah, closed
their eyes, and got up a snore, each holding between
his fingers the cheroot he had been smoking.</p>

<p>Ah, yes! It is very bad to have to endure the
frightful heat&mdash;to feel one's blood on the broil, even
under a punkah, and with doors and windows closed,
to exclude the hot air of the open day. But what
must it be for the men, the privates and their wives
and children? They have no punkahs, though it
has been shown that they might have them at a
trifling cost. They have no cold water, much less
iced water to sip&mdash;though they might have it, if the
authorities had the good sense (to put humanity entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
out of the question) to be economical of that
invaluable commodity in India, British flesh and
blood. They, the men of the ranks, and their wives
and children, have no spacious apartments (with well-fitted
doors and windows), to move about in, though
there is no reason why they should not have them,
for the land costs nothing, and labour and material is
literally dirt-cheap in the Upper Provinces of India.</p>

<p>"But the Royal Infantry Barracks at Umballah is
a fine, large building!" it may be suggested. I reply,
"Not for a regiment one thousand strong"&mdash;a regiment
mustering one thousand bayonets, to say nothing
of the numerous women, and the more numerous
children. In a cold climate, it would be ample for
their accommodation; but not here, where in a room
occupied by an officer, the thermometer frequently
stands at ninety-three degrees, and sometimes at one
hundred and five degrees. In the matter of ice, the
reader must be informed how it is manufactured.
During the "cold weather," (as the winter is always
called,) small earthenware vessels of shallow build,
resembling saucers in shape, are filled with water,
and placed in an open field, upon a low bed of straw.
At dawn of day there is a coating of ice upon each
vessel, of about the thickness of a shilling. This is
collected by men, women, and children (natives), who
receive for each morning's, or hour's work, a sum of
money, in cowries, equal to about half of a farthing.
When collected, it is carried to an ice-pit, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
stored. The expenses are borne by a subscription,
and the amount for each ticket depends entirely on
the number of subscribers. In some large stations,
an ice-ticket for the hot season costs only three pounds.
In smaller stations it will cost six pounds. The
amount of ice received by each ticket-holder is about
four pounds, and is brought away each morning at
daylight, in a canvas bag, enveloped in a thick
blanket, by the ticket-holder's own servant. It is
then deposited in a basket made expressly for the
purpose. In this basket is placed the wine, beer,
water, butter, and fruit. The bag of solid ice is in
the centre of all these, and imparts to each an equal
coldness. These four pounds of ice, if properly
managed, and the air kept out of the basket, will cool
an inconceivable quantity of fluids, and will last for
twenty-four hours&mdash;that is to say, there will be some
ice remaining when the fresh bag is brought in. If
a bewildered khansamah, or khitmutghur, in his
haste to bring a bottle, leaves the basket uncovered,
the inevitable consequence is, that the ice melts, and
there is an end of it for the day. I have scarcely
known a family in which corporal punishment was
not inflicted on the servant guilty of such a piece of
neglect. But, great as was the privation, it was
always cheerfully endured by the society, when the
doctors of the various departments indented on them
for their shares of ice respectively. And this occasionally
happened, when the hospitals were crowded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
with cases of fever. Scores and scores of lives were
often saved by the application of ice to the head, and
the administration of cold drinks.</p>

<p>Ice is not manufactured below Benares. Calcutta
and its immediate neighbourhood revels in the luxury
of American ice, which may be purchased for three
half-pence per seer (two pounds). The American
ships, trading to India, take it as ballast, which by
the time it arrives in the river Hooghley becomes a
solid mass.</p>

<p>The sun has gone down, and it is now time to bathe
and dress for our evening drive. The band is playing.
We descend from the buggy, languidly; and
languidly we walk first to one carriage and then to
another, to talk with the ladies who are sitting in
them. They, the ladies, wear a very languid air, as
though life, in such a climate, were a great burden&mdash;and
it is, no doubt, a great burden from the middle
of April to the first week in October. There is a
languid air even about the liveliest tunes that the
band plays. Then we languidly drive to the mess-house
for dinner. The dinner is more a matter of
form than anything else. But the wines, which are
well iced, are partaken of freely enough&mdash;especially
the champagne. There is, of course, no intoxication;
but as the evening advances the company becomes
more jovial, and by the time the dessert is placed on
the table, that dreadful feeling of languor has, in a
great measure, taken its departure. It is now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the evening commences, and many very pleasant
evenings have been spent in that Umballah mess-room,
despite the heat. The colonel of the regiment
to which my friend belonged was a man of very good
sense; and during the hot season he sanctioned his
officers wearing, except when on parade, a white twill
jacket, of a military cut, with the regimental button;
and he had not the slightest objection to a loose necktie
instead of a tightly-fitting black stock. This matter
ought to have been sanctioned by the highest
military authority, the commander-in-chief; or rather,
it ought to have been stated in a general order that
such rational attire was approved of, instead of being
left to the caprice of a colonel, or brigadier, or general
of division. The regiment of royal cavalry, too,
were equally fortunate in their colonel. He was also
of opinion that the comfort of the officers under his
command was worthy of some consideration, and he
could not see the necessity of requiring a gentleman
to sit down to dinner in a thick red cloth jacket
(padded), and buttoned up to the very chin. But
before I left Umballah, the old General altered this,
and insisted on "this loose and unsoldierlike attire
being instantly abandoned." He had overlooked it
for several months, or, at all events, had expressed no
objection; but suddenly the major-general commanding
was aroused to observe with great regret that the
dress in some regiments was fast becoming subversive,
&amp;c., &amp;c. The reason of the major-general's sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
acuteness of observation was this:&mdash;he was about to
give a ball at his own house, and for some inexplicable
cause had not invited any of the officers of her
Majesty's &mdash;&mdash; Regiment of Foot. But on the morning
of the night on which the ball was to take place,
he requested his aide-de-camp to write the following
note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Major-General commanding the Division desires that the
band of H.M.'s &mdash;&mdash; Foot may be in attendance at the Major-General's
house at half-past nine precisely."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the band went at half-past nine, for the General
had a perfect right to order the men to attend at his
house whenever he pleased; but the band went without
their musical instruments, for they (as I believe is
the case in all regiments) were the private property of
the officers for the time being, and, like the regimental
plate, the loan thereof for any particular occasion must
be regarded as a matter of favour, and not as a matter
of right. So the General had no music out of the
band: and the officers in the station had no comfort
in their dress, until the General left the station for
his command at Bombay.</p>

<p>It may possibly be imagined that the General had,
in his earlier days, done the State great service as a
military commander, and for that his appointment
was the reward. Nothing of the kind. When he
left the army, and became unattached, he was only a
regimental colonel, and had only been once mentioned
by the Duke of Wellington in his despatches, as having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
gallantly led his regiment into action; for this
single mention he was made a brevet major-general
and a C.B., while other colonels who had performed
precisely the same service, remained unpromoted and
undecorated. Sometimes, during his Indian career&mdash;not
that he was intoxicated by wine, for the General
in his dotage was rather abstemious&mdash;he would be
utterly oblivious to the fact that he <i>was</i> in India, and
would hold a conversation with some young ensign,
(who had been one of his dinner party, and who, in
haste to get away early to billiards, came up to say
good night) after the following fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, my pretty boy, as you will be passing
Fribourg and Pontet's, just look in and tell them&mdash;O,
how like you are to your dear mother! I can remember
her when she was thought, and truly, to be
one of the prettiest women in all Europe! Charming
eyes&mdash;lovely complexion! Well, look in at Fribourg
and Pontet's."</p>

<p>"Yes, General."</p>

<p>"And tell them to send me a canister of the Duke
of Kent's mixture. O! how very like you are to your
dear mother, my pretty boy! The last they sent me
had scent in it. Tell them I hate scent in snuff."</p>

<p>"Yes, General."</p>

<p>"O! how <span class="smcap">VERY</span> like you are to your dear mother!"</p>

<p>(The General had never seen the boy's mother in
the course of his long and useless life.)</p>

<p>"Yes, General."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, do not forget the snuff."</p>

<p>"O, no, General! Good night."</p>

<p>"God bless thee, my pretty boy! O! how like
you are to your dear mother!"</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that General Sir Doodle
Dudley was an average specimen of the General
officers sent out by the Horse Guards to command
divisions in India. That would be untrue: for
some, though very old and inefficient, could see, hear,
and understand. But within the past ten years, some
others that I know of have been sent out, to Bengal
alone, who were not one whit more efficient than
General Sir Doodle Dudley.</p>

<p>The nights being more enjoyable, comparatively,
than the days, no wonder that they are rarely given
up for sleep by the majority of military men or
younger civilians in India. Of course, married men
with families must, and do, for the most part, lead
regular lives, or, at all events, conform to some fixed
domestic rules. But it is not so with the unmarried,
who take their rest (sleep) much in the same way
that inveterate drunkards take their drink&mdash;"little
and often." You will see a young officer playing at
billiards at half-past two or three in the morning, and
at five you will see him on the parade-ground with
his company. He has had his sleep and his bath,
and, to use his own words, he "feels as fresh as a
three-year-old." Between seven and twelve he will
also have an hour or so of "the balmy," and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
after tiffin, he will perhaps get a few winks while
reading the newspaper or a book, or while sitting on
the bench in the billiard-room, "watching the game."
Have these young men, it may be asked, nothing to
do? Have they no occupation? Yes. They have
to keep themselves alive and in good spirits, and that
is no easy task either, in the hot weather of the
Upper Provinces. Some of them (a few) in the East
India Company's Service will take to studying the
languages, in the hope that proficiency therein will
lead to staff employ. Those, however, who do not
happen to have good interest to back their claims soon
find out that the order of the Governor-General in
Council touching a knowledge of the Native languages
is a mere sham; and that ignorance clothed
with interest is&mdash;so far as advancement in life is concerned&mdash;far
preferable to a well-stored head and a
steady character.</p>

<h2>MILITARY MATTERS.</h2>


<p>"A court martial! Is it possible?" exclaimed my
friend, on looking into the general order book, which
was put before him on the breakfast-table. "Well, I
did not think it would come to that."</p>

<p>"I did," said the Major of the regiment, who was
sitting opposite to him. "For it strikes me that the
chief is never so happy as when he is squabbling with
the members of the courts, and publicly reprimanding
them for their inconsistency, or whatever else may
occur to him. This is the seventh court martial held
in this station within the past two months, and with
the exception of one case, the whole of them were unnecessary."</p>

<p>I was tempted to ask who was to be tried.</p>

<p>"Two boys," replied the Major, "who thought proper
to quarrel at the mess-table, and to make use of
a certain little word, not altogether becoming gentlemen,
if applied to one another. The Senior Captain,
who was the senior officer present, very properly put
them under arrest, and sent them to their quarters.
Our Colonel, who is, I am very happy to say, extremely
particular on this as well as on every other
point that tends to preserve the tone and character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the regiment, wished these lads to receive from a
higher authority than himself a severe reprimand.
That authority was the General of the Division; and
if the General of the Division had been Sir Joseph
Thackwell, an officer of sound judgment, or any commander
of Sir Joseph's stamp, all would have been
well. But the Colonel, who has since found out the
mistake that he made in not weighing the individual
character of Sir Doodle, forwarded the case on to him
through the Brigadier in the regular way, the young
gentlemen meanwhile remaining under arrest. The
Colonel also saw Sir Doodle privately, and pointed
out to him, so far as he could make himself understood,
that a severe reprimand was all that was required.
Sir Doodle, however, did not view the matter
in this light, and forwarded the proceedings to the
Commander-in-Chief, at Simlah. After a fortnight's
delay, during which time those two boys have been
confined to their respective bungalows, the order has
come down for a general court martial, to assemble
and try them. This will involve a further imprisonment
of some three or four weeks; for the chief is
sure to find fault with the court's finding, and
send back the proceedings for revision and reconsideration
previous to confirming and approving of
them."</p>

<p>"And what do you suppose will be the upshot?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"That the lads will be released, or ordered to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
to their duty," said the Major. "Have you ever
witnessed a military court martial?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then I would advise you to witness this."</p>

<p>On the following day, a frightfully hot day, the
thermometer being at ninety-two, I accompanied my
friend in his buggy to the mess-room of the regiment,
where I beheld some five-and-twenty officers in full
dress. All these officers were in some way or other
connected with the trial; besides these there were
present some five-and-thirty officers in red or blue
jackets, but without their swords; these were spectators.
It was altogether a very imposing scene; especially
when the thirteen members took their seats
around the table, the President in the centre, and the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate of the Division opposite to
him; the prisoners standing behind the chair of the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General. The lads were now
perfectly reconciled to each other, and as good friends
as ever. Indeed, on the morning that followed their
use of the one very objectionable little word, mutual
apologies and expressions of regret passed between
them; and, in so far as the settling of the quarrel
between themselves was concerned, it was most judiciously
and satisfactorily arranged by their respective
friends.</p>

<p>The court having been duly sworn, and the charges
read aloud by the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,
the prisoners were called upon to plead. Both of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
them wished to plead guilty, and said so in a low tone
to the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General, who in an
equally low tone of voice, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, don't do that; say 'Not guilty.'"</p>

<p>"But look here, my dear fellow," said one
of the prisoners to that functionary, who was
the prosecutor on the occasion; "what's the use
of denying it? We did make two fools of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Yes; what's the use of wasting time?" said the
other prisoner.</p>

<p>"If we plead guilty, there's an end of it, and the
court can sentence us at once, and send the papers up
to Simlah by to-night's post. I am sick of that
cursed bungalow of mine, and want to have a change
of air."</p>

<p>"Well, do as you like," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate.
"But my advice is that you plead <i>Not</i>
guilty, and then in your defence you can put forth
whatever you please in extenuation, and mitigation of
the punishment."</p>

<p>"But here we are brought up for calling each other
liars in a moment of passion, and if we say we did not
call each other liars, we <i>are</i> liars."</p>

<p>"And what is more, we are liars in cold blood,"
urged one of the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Will you admit that you were drunk?" said the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.</p>

<p>"No," they both called out. "We were not strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
sober, perhaps. But where is it about being drunk?
We didn't see that in the charge."</p>

<p>"Yes, here it is, in the second instance of the second
charge, 'having while in a state of intoxication at the
mess-table of her Majesty's &mdash;&mdash; Regiment of Foot, on
the night,'" &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's an infamous falsehood, you know.
Who said that? Not Captain Stansfield, who put us
under arrest? If he swears that he shall answer for
it. Intoxicated! not a bit of it! Screwed, nothing
more!" cried the young officer in a sort of stage
whisper. "On my honour, as an officer and a gentleman,
nothing more."</p>

<p>"These charges have come down from head-quarters,
having been prepared in the office of the Judge-Advocate-General."</p>

<p>"Who is he? What's his name?" asked the
prisoners.</p>

<p>"Colonel Birch," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then he shall give up his authority."</p>

<p>"Well, plead Not guilty, and you will have it."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, off she goes: 'Not guilty!' Fifty
not guilties, if you like, on that point."</p>

<p>While this little, but interesting, debate was pending
between the prosecutor and the prisoners, the various
members of the court were holding with each other
a miscellaneous conversation, or otherwise amusing
themselves.</p>

<p>Colonel Jackstone, of the Native Infantry (who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
was the president of the court martial, in virtue of the
seniority of his rank), was talking to Colonel Colverly
of the Dragoons, about some extraordinary ailment of
his wife which required the constant administration of
brandy and soda-water, in order to keep her alive. It
was a low sinking fever, he said, from which she had
suffered for the last six or seven years at intervals of
three months; and it was always worse in the hot
weather than at any other season of the year. Captain
Bulstrade, of the Artillery, was talking to Major
Wallchaffe, of the Light (Bengal) Cavalry, concerning
a fly-trap which he had that morning invented; a
ginger-beer or soda-water bottle half filled with soapsuds
and the opening besmeared with honey or moistened
sugar. Captain Dundriffe was recommending
Captain Nolens to buy some beer which a native merchant
had recently imported into the station. Lieutenant
Blade, of the Dragoons, was playing at odd
and even with his fingers, on honour, with Lieutenant
Theston, of the same regiment; and, with a pretence
of being ready to take notes of the proceedings of the
court martial, each, pen in right hand, was keeping
an account of the score. Blade used to boast of being
the inventor of this simple game, but there were officers
in India who declared that it owed its existence
to a late Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, and who
invented it at school when he had been shut up in a
dark room (with another boy as fond of gambling as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
himself), as a punishment for card playing and other
games of chance requiring light to see what was going
on. Nothing could possibly be simpler than the
game, and played as it was, on honour, nothing could
be fairer. Blade lost thirty pounds on the first day of
the court martial, but won the greater part of it back
on the day following. Of course it would not do to
play at this game with strangers or promiscuous acquaintances.
Lieutenant Belterton of the regiment
was making use of the pens, ink, and paper, by
sketching the President and several others who had
somewhat prominent noses; and young Lofter was
trying to rival him in this amusement. My own
friend was very busy writing; and, from the serious
expression on his countenance, you might have fancied
he was composing a sermon, or writing a letter of advice
to a refractory son; he folded up the paper, and
passed it round till at last it reached me. I opened it,
and read as follows:&mdash;"We shall be here till four.
Take the buggy and drive up to the bungalow, and
tell the khitmutghur to bring down the ice-basket,
also Mr. Belterton's ice-basket, with a plentiful supply
of soda-water from our mess; for they are rather short
here, and can't stand a heavy run upon them. Tell
him also to bring several bottles of our Madeira, for
theirs I do not like, and won't drink. It has not age,
and has not travelled sufficiently. Cigars also. I am
literally bathed in perspiration, and so I fancy are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
most of us at this end of the table, for the punkah is
too far distant to admit of our receiving any benefit
therefrom. This is an awful business."</p>

<p>In compliance with the request contained in the
above note, I left the Court, drove off as rapidly as
possible, and communicated my friend's wishes to his
servant, who immediately hastened to fulfil them.
By the time I returned to the Court the first witness
was under examination. Such a waste of time!
Such a trial to the temper of all present! Instead of
allowing the Senior Captain to state the facts&mdash;and
he would have done so in less than three minutes&mdash;and
then take them down on paper, each question
was written on a slip of paper, and submitted to the
President, by the Deputy-Judge-Advocate, who
showed it to the officers sitting on either side of him,
who nodded assent. The question was then read
aloud to the witness:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Were you present on the night of the 10th of
April, at the mess-table of her Majesty's &mdash;&mdash; Regiment
of Foot?"</p>

<p>The Captain replied, "I was."</p>

<p>The question and answer were then copied into
"the book," and the slip of paper on which the question
was originally written was torn up. This occupied
(for the Deputy-Judge-Advocate was not a rapid
writer, and was apparently in no particular hurry,
being a man of very equable temperament) eight
minutes. The second question was put in precisely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
the same way, the same ceremonies having been gone
through. The second question was:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Were the prisoners present on that occasion?"</p>

<p>"They were," replied the Captain.</p>

<p>Again the copying process went on, slowly and
methodically, and Blade, who was still playing odd
and even, called out in a loud voice, to make it
appear that he was giving up his mind entirely to the
investigation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"What was the answer? I did not hear it distinctly;
be so good as to request the witness to speak
up."</p>

<p>"He said, 'They were,'" returned the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.</p>

<p>"Oh! 'They were,'" repeated Blade; writing
down a mark, signifying that he had just lost four
rupees.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes had now elapsed, and the above
was all that had been elicited from the first witness,
who was seemingly as impatient as most of the members
of the Court. The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,
however, had patience enough for all present,
and so had Blade, and his adversary at odd and
even. My friend having scowled at Blade for putting
his question, and thus prolonging the inquiry, that
aggravating officer now periodically spoke to the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General, who invariably put
down his pen to answer him; just as if he could not
possibly speak with that instrument in his hand. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
was a quarter-past two when the examination in chief
was concluded. It began at twelve precisely; so
that two hours and fifteen minutes had been consumed
in taking down the following, and no more:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was present on the night in question, and
placed the prisoners under an arrest, for giving each
other the lie in an offensive and ungentlemanlike
manner. They were excited seemingly by the wine
they had taken; but I cannot say that they were
drunk."</p>

<p>The Court then adjourned for half-an-hour to the
mess-room, to take some refreshment&mdash;every one
dripping, drenched. Then came the opening the
fronts of the thick red cloth coats, and the imbibing
of brandy and soda-water, iced beer, and other fluids,
and sundry violent exclamations, that it was worse
than the battle of Sobraon&mdash;more trying to the constitution.
Every one then sat down to tiffin; and,
having hastily devoured a few morsels, smoked
cheroots.</p>

<p>"I say, Blade," said the Senior Captain, "what
did you mean by wishing me to speak up? Surely
you heard my answer?"</p>

<p>"Mean, my dear fellow? I meant nothing&mdash;or if
I did, it was only to take a mild rise out of you.
However, don't interrupt me just now, for I am
thinking over a lot of questions I intend to put to
you, when we get back into Court."</p>

<p>"Questions? About what?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>"About drink! That's all I will tell you now.
You don't suppose that I was born the son of a judge
of the Queen's Bench for nothing, do you? If so, you
are vastly mistaken. Is that your Madeira, or ours?"</p>

<p>"Ours."</p>

<p>"Then just spill some into this glass. Ours is not
good, certainly, but it would not do to say so before
the Colonel. Ah!" sighed the lieutenant, after taking
a draught: "that is excellent! Yes. Drink is the
topic on which I intend to walk into you, practically.
And be very careful how you answer, or you will have
the Commander-in-Chief down upon you with five-and-twenty
notes of admiration at the end of every
sentence of his general order; thirty-five notes of interrogation
in the same; and every other word in
italics, or capitals, in order to impress the matter of
his decision firmly on our minds. 'Was the Court
raving mad? Witness ought to be tried!!! folly!
imbecility! childishness! The veriest schoolboy
ought to know better! Deputy-Judge-Advocate
ignorant of his duty!!! The President insane!!!!
Confirmed, but not approved!!!"</p>

<p>"What are you making such a noise about, Blade?"
inquired the Colonel of his regiment, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, Colonel," said Blade. "No noise. But
here is a man who has the audacity, in our own mess-house,
to asperse the character of our Madeira."
And, taking up the Senior Captain's own bottle, and
holding it before the Senior Captain's face, he exclaimed,&mdash;looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
at the Colonel, "He positively refuses to taste it, even."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the cavalry Colonel, approaching
them with a serious air, and with an empty glass in
his hand. "Nonsense! Do you really mean to say
that our Madeira is not good&mdash;excellent?"</p>

<p>"No, Colonel," said the Senior Captain of the
Royal Infantry regiment.</p>

<p>"Taste it, and say what you think of it, Colonel,"
said Blade, filling the Colonel's glass, which was held
up to receive the liquid, with a willingness which
imparted some mirth to the beholders. "Taste it.
There."</p>

<p>"I have tasted it," said the Colonel, "and pronounce
it to be the best I ever drank in my life, and,
in my judgment, infinitely superior to that of any
other mess."</p>

<p>"So I say," said Blade, filling his glass; "but the
misfortune is, he won't believe me."</p>

<p>"Order a fresh bottle of our wine for him, Blade,"
said the Colonel, "and let him taste the top of it."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, Colonel," said the Senior Captain;
"I would rather not. Remember, I have to conclude
my examination."</p>

<p>"Ah, so you have," said the Colonel, moving away.
"But take my word for it, that better Madeira than
ours was never grown or bottled."</p>

<p>When the Court resumed its sitting, I observed
that some of the members of the Court became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
drowsy, and dropped off to sleep, opening one eye
occasionally, for a second or two; others became
fidgety, impetuous, and argumentative. The President
inquired if the members of the Court would like
to ask the witness any questions. Several responded
in the affirmative, and began to write their questions
on slips of paper. Blade, however, was the first to
throw his slip across the table to the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,
who, having read it, handed it
across to the President, who showed it to the officers
on either side of him, who nodded assent. The question
was then handed back to the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,
who proceeded to read it aloud.</p>

<p>"You have stated that the prisoners were under
the influence of wine, but that they were not drunk.
What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean," said the Senior Captain, "that they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so quick, please," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.
"You mean that?&mdash;Yes&mdash;I am
quite ready."</p>

<p>"I mean," said the witness, "that though they had
both been partaking freely of wine, they were not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Freely of wine&mdash;don't be in a hurry," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,
repeating each word
that he took down.</p>

<p>"Mind, he says 'Freely,'" said Blade. "'Freely
of wine.' The word 'freely' is important&mdash;very important.
Have you got down the word freely?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
having put down his pen to ascertain the fact, and
make it known to his interrogator.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Blade. "Then put the rest of
the answer down, at your earliest convenience. I am
in no particular hurry."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
to the witness&mdash;"they were not&mdash;not what?"</p>

<p>"Not drunk," said the witness.</p>

<p>"There is nothing about drunkenness in the
charges," said the President; "where are the
charges?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.
"But, please let me write down your remark
before we go any further."</p>

<p>"What remark?" inquired the President.</p>

<p>"That there is nothing about drunkenness in the
charges. According to the last general order by his
Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, on the last
court martial held in this station, everything that
transpires should be recorded." And the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
then resumed his writing in
the slowest and most provoking manner imaginable.
Several of the audience walked out of the Court, and
went into the room where the refreshments were. I
followed them. We remained absent for more than
ten minutes; but, when we came back, the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
had not yet written up to
the desired point, previous to going on with Blade's
question. This at length accomplished, he looked at
the President and said, "Yes, sir?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is nothing about drunkenness, and the
prisoners are not charged with it," said the President.
"The words, 'while in a state of intoxication,' are to
all intents and purposes surplusage."</p>

<p>"There I differ with you, sir," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Blade.</p>

<p>"Clear the Court!" cried the President; whereupon
the audience, the prisoners, the witnesses&mdash;in
fact, all save the members of the Court and the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General, withdrew, whilst a
discussion, which lasted for three-quarters of an hour
was carried on, every member giving his opinion,
and most of them speaking at the same time.</p>

<p>When we returned to the Court, after three-quarters
of an hour's absence, the Senior Captain
resumed his seat near the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.
We were not informed of what had taken
place. A pause of several minutes ensued, when
Blade threw across the table another little slip on
which was written a long sentence. The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
handed it to the President,
who, on reading it, looked a good deal astonished,
and shook his head, whereupon Blade, who was
evidently bent on mischief, called out, "We are all of
that opinion at this end of the table."</p>

<p>The President then handed Blade's written question
to the officer who sat next to him on his right,
and that officer passed it on to the next, the next to
the next, and so on till it had been seen by every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
member of the Court. Some signified by a nod,
some by a shake of the head, others by a shrug of the
shoulders, what they thought about it; and as there
seemed to be a difference of opinion, the Court was
again cleared in order that the vote for or against
might be taken. So once more we were driven into
the mess-room to refresh ourselves and laugh over the
absurdity of the whole proceeding. After waiting
there for about five-and-thirty minutes, the Adjutant
announced, in a loud voice, "The Court is open!"
and we returned to hear the President say that, as it
was now nearly four o'clock, the Court must be
adjourned&mdash;another absurdity in connexion with
courts martial. After four o'clock, the Court must
not sit, even if twenty minutes in excess of that hour
would end the proceedings, and render another meeting
unnecessary.</p>

<p>The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General then locked
up his papers in a box, placed it under his arm,
bowed to the Court, walked off, called for his buggy,
and drove home. The members of the Court, the
prisoners, and the audience then dispersed, and retired
to their respective bungalows; all very tired,
and very glad of some repose. My friend, on taking
off his coat, asked me to feel the weight of it, out of
curiosity. Saturated as it was, it must, including
the epaulettes, have weighed some five-and-twenty
pounds.</p>

<p>The next day at eleven the Court again met. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
first thing that was done was to read the proceedings
of the previous day. This duty was performed by the
Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General, and, slowly as he
read, it was over in twelve minutes, for I timed him.
That is to say, it had taken four hours and a half to
get through the real business of twelve minutes, or,
giving a very liberal margin, the business of half-an-hour.</p>

<p>And now another very curious feature of an Indian
court martial presented itself. The President asked
the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General if he had furnished
the prisoners with a copy of the past day's
proceedings. The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No; the prisoners had not asked for a copy."</p>

<p>The President said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"That does not signify. Did you tender them a
copy?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to have done so."</p>

<p>The prisoners here said that they did not want a
copy.</p>

<p>The President's answer to this innocent remark was,
that whatever they had to say they must reserve till
they were called upon for their defence.</p>

<p>Desirous of not provoking the animosity of the President,
they bowed, and very respectfully thanked him
for the suggestion. Whereupon the President, who
was a terrible talker, and passionately fond of allusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
to his own career in the army, mentioned a case
within his own personal knowledge. It was a case
that happened in Canada, and he had reason, he said,
to remember it, because he was at the time on the staff
of that distinguished officer, Sir James Kemp, and
heard Sir James remark upon it. The Honourable
Ernest Augustus Fitzblossom, a younger son of the
Earl of Millflower, was tried for cheating at cards,
was found guilty, and sentenced to be cashiered.
This sentence was confirmed and approved by the
General Commanding-in-Chief, and the Honourable
Lieutenant went home. An appeal was made to
the Horse Guards, and it came out that no copy of
each day's proceedings had been tendered to the
prisoner, and upon that ground the whole of the proceedings
were declared by his Royal Highness the
Duke of York to be null and void. He (the President)
did not mean to offer any opinion on that case,
but he merely quoted it, and being on Sir James's
staff at the time, he had reason to remember, in order
to show that such was the rule.</p>

<p>A Captain in the Bengal Cavalry said he knew of
a case which occurred in this country (India) where
the very reverse was held. The prisoner&mdash;a Lieutenant
Burkett, of the Bengal Native Infantry&mdash;was
tried for being drunk whilst on outpost duty. The
trial lasted for seventeen days, for no less than thirty-eight
witnesses&mdash;principally natives&mdash;were examined.
The Lieutenant, at the close of the case for the prosecution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
demanded a copy of the proceedings, in order
to assist him in drawing up his defence. His demand
was not complied with. He was convicted and dismissed
the service. He appealed to the Commander-in-Chief,
who ruled that a prisoner had no right whatever
to a copy of the proceedings until after his conviction,
and therefore he confirmed and approved the
sentence, or rather, as he had done that already, he
rejected the appeal.</p>

<p>"Did he appeal to the Horse Guards?" asked the
President.</p>

<p>"No; he belonged to the Company's service."</p>

<p>"Well, did he appeal to the Directors? They
might have restored him. They have just restored a
man, Bagin, who was cashiered two years ago for gross
fraud and falsehood in several instances."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Bagin was in my regiment. But
Bagin has an uncle in the direction, besides a stepfather
who would have had to support him and his
family if his commission had not been restored to
him. Burkett had no friends, and very lucky for him."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He entered the service of a native prince, and,
being a steady fellow and a clever fellow, he made a
fortune in the course of nine years, and is now living
at home on his fifteen hundred a year."</p>

<p>"I know of another case," said another member of
the court, and he proceeded to detail the particulars.
When he had finished, another member told of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
case; and so this desultory narration of individual experiences
went on for one hour and a half&mdash;the Deputy-Judge-Advocate,
with his tongue protruding,
writing away as methodically as possible. What he
was writing I do not know; but I fancy he was taking
down the "heads" of the various cases that were
quoted, in order that his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief
might have the satisfaction of examining
them. I was told afterwards that we, the audience,
and the prisoners, ought not to have been allowed to
remain in court during this narration of cases, and the
anecdotes which the narrators wove into them; but I
need scarcely say I was very glad that our presence
had been overlooked; for if I had not seen and heard
what took place, I should not certainly have believed,
and therefore should not have dreamt of
describing, it. It was during this conversation that
Blade won back from his adversary, at odd and even,
the greater portion of the money he had lost on the
previous day; nor that either Blade or his adversary
failed to take a part in the conversation, for both of
them would now and then ejaculate "What an extraordinary
case!" "Did you ever!" "No, never!"
"It seems impossible!" "Cashiered him?" "Shameful!"
"Who could have been the chairman of the
Court of Directors?" "A Dissenter, I'll be bound!"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," said the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
to the President, when he had finished his
writing, "what shall we do? Shall we adjourn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Court until a copy of yesterday's proceedings is made,
and given to the prisoners?"</p>

<p>"No doubt," said the President; "that is the only
way in which the error can be repaired. But a copy
must be delivered to each of them."</p>

<p>"But had we better not take the opinion of the
Court on the subject?" suggested the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General.</p>

<p>"By all means," conceded the President; "but in
that case, the Court must be cleared, while the votes
are taken."</p>

<p>"Clear the Court!" cried the Adjutant; and out
we all marched again, into the mess-room, where
more cheroots were smoked, and more weak brandy-and-water
imbibed.</p>

<p>The third day came, and the Court re-assembled.
The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General read over the
entire proceedings, beginning from the very beginning,
the swearing of the members, up to the adjournment
of the Court, and the reasons for such adjournment.
Here another discussion or conversation ensued, as to
whether it was necessary to read more than the last
day's proceedings. The Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
said he was quite right. The President
thought otherwise. All the other members of the Court
spoke on the subject, many of them at the same time.
Blade and his adversary also gave their opinions, the
former for, and the latter opposed to the view taken
by the President. As this was a point that must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
cleared up, insomuch as the decision that might be
come to would regulate the future proceedings in this
respect, the Court was again "cleared," and we again
marched into the room where the refreshments were
to be had. In half-an-hour's time we were re-admitted.
But it was not until the following day (for
members are not allowed, in short, they are bound
by oath not to divulge what may be decided when
the doors are closed), that we learnt the Deputy-Judge-Advocate-General
had carried his point, and
that a sort of parody of that old nursery story, about
"the fire began to burn the stick, the stick began to
beat the dog, the dog began to bite the pig," was the
proper way to open the proceedings of each day during
a protracted trial by general court-martial!</p>

<p>So curiously is human nature constituted, that I, in
common with the rest of the audience, began, after
the fifth day, to like the business, and to watch
its various twistings and turnings with great
interest. The mess-house, at which the Court was
held, became a favourite lounge for almost everybody
in the station; and it was curious to hear the bets
that were made with reference to the probable "finding,"
and the sentence. The trial lasted over thirteen
days, inclusive of two Sundays which intervened;
and the proceedings were then forwarded to Simlah,
where they remained for a fortnight awaiting the
decision of the Commander-in-Chief, who, in fulfilment
of Blade's prophecy, certainly did put forth
"a snorter of a General Order," and as full as it could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
be of italics, capitals, and notes of exclamation and
interrogation. His Excellency "walked into" the
President, and recommended him to study some catechism
of the Law of Courts Martial, such a book as
children might understand. His Excellency further
remarked that the Senior Captain (the principal witness),
or any man wearing a sword, ought to be ashamed
of admitting that he was unable to define the various
stages of intoxication; and that he was astounded to
find that the Court in general should have paid so little
attention to the admirable reasoning, on this point, of
a junior member whose intelligence appeared to have
enlisted no sympathy. (This had reference to Blade.)
His Excellency went on to say, that he had never
himself been drunk in the whole course of his long
life, and to that fact he attributed his position; that
if the Court had done its duty it would have cashiered
the prisoners; that a "severe reprimand which the
Court awarded was a mockery which stunk in the
nostrils," and that the prisoners were to be released
from arrest and return to their duty without receiving
it. But the Chief did not end here. He went on to
say, that he would maintain the discipline of the
British army in the East, in all ranks, or else he would
know the reason why. And being, I fancy, in some
difficulty as to what to use, in the case (whether
marks of admiration or interrogation), he emphasized
the last word of this culminating and very relevant
sentence thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">"WHY?!!!"</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a matter of grave doubt whether the determination,
thus expressed, to uphold discipline in the
army, was in any way assisted by such general orders
as those fired off from the pen of the ardent Commander-in-Chief;
the more especially as such general
orders were copied into the newspapers, and were
read by (or listened to while others were reading
aloud,) every non-commissioned officer and private in
Upper India, Native and European. Three weeks
after the promulgation of the general order just alluded
to, a trooper in the dragoons having been talked
to seriously by the captain of the troop, for some
irregular conduct, thus unburthened himself:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You! What do I care for what <span class="smcap">YOU</span> say? You
are one of those infernal fools whom the Commander-in-Chief
pitched into the other day for <span class="smcap">BEING</span> a fool."
And as the peroration of this speech consisted of the
dashing off of the speaker's cap, and hurling it into
the captain's face, the man was tried, convicted, and
sentenced to be transported for life.</p>

<p>If it be inquired by the reader whether the above
description of a Court Martial in India is a fair specimen
of what usually transpires at these tribunals, I
reply, emphatically, "Yes;" and I make the assertion
after having watched the proceedings of no fewer
than eighteen Courts Martial during my sojourn in
the East Indies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four officers who had obtained six months' leave of
absence, and who had rented between them a furnished
house at Simlah, were about to proceed there.
I was tempted to accompany them. We left Umballah
at sunset in palkees, and at seven o'clock on
the following morning arrived at the foot of the hills,
at a place called Kalka, where there is an hotel.
Having breakfasted, we commenced the ascent on
ponyback, and in the course of an hour and a half
arrived at Kussowlie, where a regiment of her
Majesty's Foot was quartered. Here we rested for
a brief while, and then pursued our journey.
Strange to say, although the climate is superb,
and the scenery grand beyond description, the men
(so I was told) preferred the plains, regarding them&mdash;to
use their own words&mdash;"less like a prison than the
hills." From Kussowlie we pushed on to Sir√©e,
which is about half way between Simlah and Kalka.
Here there is a bungalow, at which we dined on the
everlasting "grilled fowl," hard-boiled eggs, and
unleavened bread. Some friends at Simlah, who had
been written to previously, had sent five horses to
meet us; so that, when we resumed our journey, we
were mounted on fresh cattle. All along the road
the scenery is extremely picturesque and beautiful;
but, in point of grandeur, it does not, in my opinion,
equal that of the Alps.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when we arrived at our destination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
and entered the house, where we found everything
ready for our reception; the servants had been
sent on a day or two in advance of us.</p>

<p>It is a long and fatiguing ride, forty miles in the
sun, albeit there is generally a light breeze to modify
the heat; and we were all disposed to retire to rest.
But we were unable to do so. The gentlemen who
had sent the horses to meet us, as soon as they were
informed of our arrival, came to see us, and, what was
more, to take us to a subscription ball, which was to
take place that night at the Assembly Rooms. It
was useless to plead weariness. We were compelled
to go.</p>

<p>The society of Simlah, though composed of the
same elements, differs very much from the society of
Mussoorie. The presence of the Commander-in-Chief,
or the Governor-General, and sometimes both (as was
the case when I was at Simlah), imposes a restraint
on the visitors to this sanitarium. The younger men
are less disposed to run riot, and incur the risk of having
their leave cancelled, and themselves sent down
to the plains. A ball, therefore, at Simlah differs
from a ball at Mussoorie. It is so much more sedate.
More than one half of those who prefer Simlah to
Mussoorie, do so in the hope of prepossessing one or
other of the Great Authorities, by being brought into
contact with them, and thus obtain staff employ or
promotion; and very amusing is it to look on at a
public entertainment and witness the feelings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
jealousy and of envy that swell the breasts of the
various candidates for notice and favour. Nor are the
little artifices that are resorted to unworthy of observation
and a smile. At this ball there was a lady, the
wife of a civilian (a sad fool), who had a great facility
in taking likenesses, and she had drawn the Governor-General
in every possible attitude, both on foot and
on horseback. These clever and admirably-executed
sketches were laid upon a table in the ball-room, and
excited very general admiration; and it was very soon
"buzzed about" who was the artist. The wife of
another civilian, however, maliciously neutralized the
effect these sketches would probably have had, by
falsely saying, loud enough for his Lordship to hear,
"Ah! she said she would do the trick with her
pencil!" The consequence was, that when the lady's
husband begged his Lordship would accept this collection
of portraits, as well as a few sketches of the
house inhabited by the Great Man, his Lordship,&mdash;as
delicately and as gracefully as the circumstances would
admit of,&mdash;"declined them with many thanks;" just
as though they had been so many unsuitable contributions
to some popular periodical. The wife of a
military officer, however, was rather more fortunate.
She, too, had a great talent for drawing, and had
taken an excellent likeness in water colours of the
Commander-in-Chief's favourite charger&mdash;the charger
that had carried the old Chief through his battles;
and as the lady begged that the Chief would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
accept the picture, he did so, and the next
<i>Gazette</i> made known that Captain Cloughcough was
a Major of Brigade. By the way, this was an excellent
appointment, for the office required no sort of ability,
and Cloughcough had none; he was, moreover, a most
disagreeable person in his regiment, and constantly
quarrelling with his brother officers, who were delighted
to get rid of him. To chronicle <i>all</i> the
seductive little arts which were resorted to on that
night, to effect a desired end, would half fill a volume.
But I cannot omit the following: it struck me as so
<i>extremely</i> ingenious. There was a lady, the wife of
a young civilian, who had two very pretty little children&mdash;a
boy and a girl. Of these children, the
Governor-General took great notice, and, whenever
he saw their mother, made inquiries touching "the
little pets," as he was won't to speak of them. On
the night of that ball, his Lordship did so. The lady
replied that they were quite well; but that the doctor
had said their return to the plains would be fatal to
them, and that they must be sent to England.</p>

<p>"Then you had better take the doctor's advice,"
said the Governor-General.</p>

<p>"But, alas! my Lord," said the lady, "we have
not the means. My husband's pay is only 700 rupees
a month, and we are, unfortunately, very much in
debt."</p>

<p>"That's a bad job," said my Lord.</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed the lady; "it is a very painful reflection&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
idea of losing one's little dears. But
what is to be done? I dread the coming of the 15th
of October, when my husband's leave will expire,
more than I dread my own death."</p>

<p>"Could you not remain up here with them through
the winter?"</p>

<p>"And be absent from my husband, my Lord?
Besides, two establishments on 700 rupees a month!"</p>

<p>"That is true."</p>

<p>"If we could <i>send</i> them to England under the
care of some friend, we would do so, before the hot
weather sets in. But we cannot afford it. Or if my
husband had an appointment in some healthy station,
out of the plains, then they might be spared to us.
The thought of the beautiful roses on their cheeks
just now leaving them, and their dear little faces
becoming pale and sallow, and their little limbs
shrinking till they are almost skeletons&mdash;it makes
my very heart bleed!" (And the pretty and ingenious
little lady took her kerchief, raised it to her
eyes, and suppressed something like one of Mrs.
Alfred Mellon's stage sobs, which went, straight as
an arrow, to the Governor-General's sensitive heart.)
"If," she continued, "my husband were a favourite
with the Secretary; but he is not&mdash;for he is too independent
to crave&mdash;then the case would be very
different."</p>

<p>"The Secretary!" exclaimed the Governor-General,
"what has he to do with it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>(The lady had aroused his Lordship's sympathy,
and now she had touched his pride, and inflamed his
vanity.)</p>

<p>"I thought he had all to do with it, my Lord."</p>

<p>"You shall see that he has <i>not</i>," said the Governor-General.
"Be comforted, my dear madam, and come
to the refreshment room." His Lordship gave her
his arm, and led her away from the couch on which
they had been conversing.</p>

<p>This "children's dodge," as it was called, was eminently
successful. The lady's husband was appointed
superintendent of one of the most delightful hill
stations in India, on a salary of 1200 rupees (120<i>l</i>.)
per mensem.</p>

<p>The ball over, at half-past two in the morning we
returned to our house, where I was disgusted to hear
that a leopard had carried off out of the verandah a
favourite dog of mine. It is no easy matter to keep
a dog in Simlah, except in the house. The leopards
are always on the look-out for them, and will often
carry them off in your very sight, while you are riding
or walking along the road.</p>

<p>The great business at Simlah, as at Mussoorie, is
devising the means of amusement, or rather of varying
the amusements so as to render them less irksome
than they would otherwise become. Cards and billiards
are the principal pastimes; and, now and then,
pic-nic and excursion parties are got up; and, once
or twice a month, private theatricals are resorted to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Invitations to dinner-parties and evening-parties are
plentiful enough; but to men who go to Simlah
without wives and families, and who don't intend to
marry in the East, these reunions are a bore rather,
after a brief while, and such men prefer dining under
their own roofs. There was an hotel at Simlah, kept
by a Frenchman, who provided a <i>table d'h√¥te</i> every
day at seven o'clock. This used to be very well
attended; for, generally speaking, better fare was to
be got there than anywhere else. By the way, the
host had once been an officer in the French army,
and was rather a touchy man. On one occasion an
officer complained of the character of some dish on
the table, and was challenged to "fight with either
sword or pistol." This challenge was declined; but
the officer said he would have no objection to an encounter,
provided the weapons were cold legs of
mutton.</p>

<p>There is an enormous mountain at Simlah, and
around its base there is a good macadamized road,
some fifteen feet wide. This is the favourite ride of
the visitors, and every fine afternoon some sixty
gentlemen, and nearly as many ladies, may be seen
upon it taking the fresh air.</p>

<p>Simlah is a much more expensive place to spend
the summer at than Mussoorie, in consequence of its
great distance from the plains, whence almost every
article of food and all descriptions of "stores" are
carried on men's shoulders. The mutton of the hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
sheep is not equal to Welsh mutton; but when properly
kept and dressed, it is very good eating. The
hill cattle also afford tolerable beef; but the joints
are very small. House-rent at Simlah is also much
dearer. The furnished abode, for which we paid
100<i>l</i>. for the season, we could have got at Mussoorie
for 60<i>l</i>. The same may be said of articles of clothing
and of merchandize. The majority of the European
shopkeepers (there were only five or six) appeared to
be doing a good business; but I question whether
they made money. They have to give, in most cases,
very long credit, pay high rates of interest to the
banks for money, and high rents for the extensive
premises they are obliged to occupy, to say nothing
of having to live as all English people must live in
India. The hotel did not pay the proprietor, notwithstanding
his house was generally full of people,
and his charges were seemingly exorbitant.</p>

<p>There was no club at Simlah when I was there;
but, since then, one was established. Its existence,
however, was very brief. The fact is, people in India
very soon grow tired of a thing; and, what is even
worse, you will find that when a large number of
persons, who have really nothing to do but amuse
themselves, very frequently meet, they wrangle,
quarrel, split into small coteries, and become on very
bad terms with each other. How the old Himalaya
Club at Mussoorie has existed so long, is miraculous.
A club in India is not like a club in England, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
scores of the members are unknown to each other,
even by name, and possibly do not meet more
than once in a month.</p>

<p>Some of the views at Simlah are magnificent; and
from several points may be seen, in the far distance,
the river Sutlej, stealing its way through the
mountains. The water has the appearance, when the
sun is shining upon it, of a narrow stream of quicksilver.
Some of the hills are literally covered with
rhododendron trees, fifty or sixty feet high, and when
they are all in full bloom the effect may be easily
imagined.</p>

<p>To Jutsy, some five or six miles from Simlah, and
where one of the Goorkha battalions was always stationed,
I have already alluded. There are but two or
three bungalows there, and they are occupied by the
officers of the battalion.</p>

<p>The season that I spent at Simlah was a very pleasant
one, and notwithstanding it was enlivened by
several exciting incidents&mdash;to wit, a duel, a police
affair, a court martial, and an elopement,&mdash;I was very
glad when it was over, and we could return to the
plains.</p>

<h2>TANTIA TOPEE.</h2>


<p>When I visited the Nena Sahib, I saw this miscreant,
who has since so distinguished himself as a soldier
and a general, and has recently been captured and
hanged. He was not called Tantia Topee at Bhithoor,
but "Bennie," simply. He was not a servant exactly&mdash;at
all events not a menial servant; but one of those
numerous "hangers-on" of Nena Sahib who repaid by
flattery the favours they received in the shape of
board, lodging, and presents. The name of "Tantia
Topee," so a native gentleman in India informs me,
was an assumed one; and I will, therefore, speak of
the hero as "Bennie," whom I remember sufficiently
well to describe him. I had not the least idea when
I gave him a general letter of recommendation, that he
would fill so many pages of Indian history, and give
brigades and divisions of British troops such trouble
and vexation before they succeeded in catching him.</p>

<p>Bennie was not more than thirty, and at the time
of his execution his age could not have exceeded
forty years. I question even if he were so old as that,
though he may have looked older. He was a man
of about the middle height&mdash;say five feet eight&mdash;rather
slightly made, but very erect. He was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
from good-looking. The forehead was low, the nose
rather broad at the nostrils, and his teeth irregular
and discoloured. His eyes were expressive and full
of cunning, like those of most Asiatics; but he did
not strike me as a man of eminent ability. There
were a few men amongst Nena Sahib's flatterers who
were really clever men, but they were not Mahrattas;
and my impression is that Bennie was not a Mahratta,
but a member of some obscure family in the
Upper Provinces of India, under British rule. Like
the rest of the tribe of flatterers who surrounded
Nena Sahib, Bennie was obsequious and cringing to
every European who visited Bhithoor. This demeanour,
of course, was not the offspring of respect, but
prompted rather by the impression that it might tend
to some advantage.</p>

<p>There are many persons in India, natives especially,
who are of opinion that Nena Sahib did not dictate
the atrocities that were committed at Cawnpore; but
that they were committed by order of the various
adventurers, such as Bennie, who became powerful
the moment that Nena Sahib consented to rebel and
raise his standard. Asiatics are frequently placed in
the awkward position of being responsible for the acts
of their retainers&mdash;acts that they not only do not
sanction, but forbid. This was the case with Moolraj,
the Governor of Mooltan. From the first, and to the
day of his death, he declared (and his declaration
was supported by the very strongest circumstantial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
evidence) that so far from giving an order to his
turbulent soldiery to kill or attack Messrs. Vans
Agnew and Anderson, he did all in his power to
shield them from harm. Indeed the verdict of the
camp which condemned him, rather inconsistently,
brought in a verdict of "Guilty; but a victim of
circumstances."</p>

<p>That Nena Sahib well deserves the fate that is in
store for him, whenever he is captured, there can be
no species of doubt; but, in the absence of some
proof, I should be sorry&mdash;especially after the letters I
have read on the subject&mdash;to attribute to the man
that fiendish treachery and horrible massacre which
took place at Cawnpore in July, 1857. Nena Sahib
had seen so much of English gentlemen and ladies, and
was personally (if not intimately) acquainted with so
many of the sufferers that it is only fair to suppose,
when he ordered boats to be got ready, he was sincere
in his desire that the Christians should find their
way to Calcutta, and that what ensued was in violation
of his orders, and the act of those who wished to
place for ever between Nena Sahib and the British
Government an impassable barrier, so far as peace
and reconciliation were concerned. No one knew
better than Nena Sahib that, in the event of the
British becoming again the conquerors of India, the
very fact of his having spared the lives of those who
surrendered, would have led to the sparing of his own
life, and hence the promise he made to Sir Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Wheeler. One friend (a gentleman of great experience)
writing from India on this subject, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In my opinion it was the Mahommedan soldiery
who insisted on that awful measure. Having so
many helpless Christians in their absolute power,
they could not resist the temptation of sacrificing
them, for their <i>faith's sake</i>."</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that previous to hanging
"Tantia Topee," some statement was not extracted
from him touching what took place at Cawnpore. Of
course, it could not have been relied upon <i>per se</i>, but,
as evidence, confirmatory or contradictory, of other
statements made by other miscreants, who may yet
fall into our power, it would not have been <i>entirely</i>
valueless. I do not mean to say that the culprit
should have been allured to confess by any promise,
or insinuation, that his life would be spared if he
spoke the truth. That is, I would not have breathed
the word of promise to his ear, and then have broken
it to the hope; nor would I have subjected him to
any <i>corporeal</i> torture. Nevertheless, I would have
had "out of him" something like "the truth"&mdash;if
not "the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,"
and so would Sir John Lawrence, or Mr. Wingfield,
now at Lucknow, or Mr. Dampier, or Major Elwall,
and a score of ex-Thuggee officers now living. It is
a sad mistake to hang this sort of people in a hurry;
or, for the matter of that, to hang them at all. They
have not that dread of death that Europeans have,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
but almost invariably meet their fate without exhibiting
the faintest fear. There are punishments
which, to their minds, are far more terrible. They
are not as "cowards who die a thousand deaths in
dreading one which must come at last." They are
rather cowards who die a thousand deaths in dreading
one <i>life</i> which they long to end. I was never
more impressed with the truth of this than when,
with the permission of Lord Dalhousie, I had an interview
with Moolraj in his cell at Lahore; he was
then under the charge of Dr. (now Sir John) Logie,
who is "in attendance" on the Maharajah Dulleep
Singh. The constant cry of the wretched captive
was, "Ah, let them take my life by one blow; but
not draw it out of me by slow degrees!" As far as I
can recollect, it was not then decided whether his life
should be spared or not.</p>

<p>I would treat culprits like Tantia Topee, Nena
Sahib, Bahadoor Khan, the Nawab of Bandah, &amp;c.,
much in the same way as the convicts of Norfolk
Island were treated in former days&mdash;make death the
first favour for which they should crave, and the last
which should be granted unto them; but with this
difference, that if they murdered each other, the hope
of ending their days for the deed should be a vain
one. To hang such men is to frustrate the end and
real object of all punishment, which is to deter others
from the commission of the same offence. When
such men are exterminated they are speedily forgotten,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
and their end is not regarded as an example for the
prevention of evil; but so long as they are living, and
suffering what to them is far worse than death, the
case is otherwise. Be it known, however, that I am
not an advocate for the abolition of capital punishment
in <i>this</i> country for the crime of murder. The
gallows, judiciously used, is, in my humble judgment,
a very wholesome terror.</p>
